Most of these versions exist in Marvel's main  shared universe , known as the  Marvel Universe .\n In the  Marvel Cinematic Universe ,  Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers)  is portrayed by  Brie Larson . A female  Mar-Vell  was portrayed by  Annette Bening , and  Monica Rambeau  is portrayed by  Teyonah Parris .\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Publication history \n \n 1.1   Mar-Vell \n 1.2   Monica Rambeau \n 1.3   Genis-Vell \n 1.4   Phyla-Vell \n 1.5   Khn'nr \n 1.6   Noh-Varr \n 1.7   Carol Danvers \n \n \n 2   Other versions \n \n 2.1   Ultimate Captain Marvel \n 2.2   Ruins \n 2.3   Fantastic Four: The End \n 2.4   House of M \n 2.5   Marvel Zombies \n 2.6   Cancerverse \n 2.7   Amalgam Comics \n 2.8   Age of Ultron \n \n \n 3   In other media \n 4   References \n 5   Sources \n 6   External links \n \n \n\n Publication history [ edit ] \n Following a trial in which  DC Comics  sued  Fawcett Comics  for breach of  copyright , claiming  Fawcett's Captain Marvel  was too similar to  Superman , the latter stopped publishing Captain Marvel in 1953. [2]  In the late 1960s Marvel gained the  trademark  \"Captain Marvel\" with their first series.\n In order to retain their trademark, Marvel has published a  Captain Marvel  title at least once every few years since, leading to a number of  ongoing series ,  limited series , and  one-shots  featuring a range of characters using the Captain Marvel alias. [3] \n \n Mar-Vell [ edit ] \n Main article:  Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell) \n The first Captain Marvel printed by Marvel Comics was created by  Stan Lee  and  Gene Colan . [4]  This character is an  alien  military officer,  Captain Mar-Vell  of the  Kree  Imperial Militia, who is sent to observe the planet  Earth  as it is developing technology to travel into space. Mar-Vell eventually wearies of his superiors' malicious intent and allies himself with Earth, and the Kree Empire brands him a traitor.  From then on, Mar-Vell fights to protect Earth from all threats.\n He was later revamped by  Roy Thomas  and  Gil Kane . Having been exiled to the  Negative Zone  by the  Supreme Intelligence , the only way Mar-Vell can temporarily escape is to exchange atoms with  Rick Jones  by means of special wristbands called Nega-Bands. [5]  He is also given superpowers, and his Kree military uniform is replaced with a form fitting costume. The process of the young man being replaced in a flash by the older superhero was a nod to the original Fawcett Captain Marvel, which had young Billy Batson saying the magic word \"Shazam\" to transform into the hero.\n With the title's sales still flagging, Marvel allowed  Jim Starlin  to conceptually revamp the character, [6]  although his appearance was little changed.  Mar-Vell is freed from the Negative Zone and becomes a cosmic champion, the \"Protector of the Universe\" appointed by the cosmic entity  Eon .  Together, Mar-Vell and Rick continue to battle against evil, most notably battling the Death-worshipping  Thanos . Mar-Vell became a close ally of the  Titans , and one of their number,  Elysius , became his lover.\n His career was cut short when he developed inoperable cancer, the result of an earlier exposure to toxic  nerve gas  during a battle with  Nitro . He died from this cancer on Titan in the presence of the Marvel Universe's superhero community, as chronicled in Marvel's first large-format  graphic novel ,  The Death of Captain Marvel , published in 1982. [7] \n \n Monica Rambeau [ edit ] \n Main article:  Monica Rambeau \n The second Captain Marvel was created by writer  Roger Stern  and artist  John Romita, Jr. . She first appeared in  The Amazing Spider-Man  Annual  #16 (1982).\n The character is  Monica Rambeau , a police lieutenant from  New Orleans   Louisiana , who possesses the power to transform herself into any form of  energy . [8]   Her powers were briefly altered so that she cannot transform to energy, but instead can generate a personal force field. [9]  Sometime later, the  Stranger  returned her energy-transformation abilities. She is a member of the  Avengers , and at one point she served as their leader.  She eventually ceded the Captain Marvel name to the original Captain Marvel's son after which Rambeau took the name  Photon , [10]  using that name for quite some time until  Genis-Vell  adopted the same name. Genis-Vell and Monica discussed this, and Monica decided on the name  Pulsar . [11] \n Rambeau later joined H.A.T.E. (the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort) in the new series titled  Nextwave . [12]  In this series created by  Warren Ellis  and  Stuart Immonen , H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the  Beyond Corporation ) forms a team to fight the Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. Members include Monica Rambeau, a man known only as  The Captain ,  Boom Boom ,  Aaron Stack , and  Elsa Bloodstone . She returned to the Avengers using the codename  Spectrum .\n \n Genis-Vell [ edit ] \n Main article:  Genis-Vell \n The third Captain Marvel is  Genis-Vell , who first appeared in  Silver Surfer  Annual  #6 (1993) using the codename of \"Legacy\". The character is the genetically-engineered son of Mar-Vell and his lover Elysius, created from the late Mar-Vell's cell samples and artificially aged to physical, if not emotional, maturity.  Genis, like his father, wears the Nega-Bands, possesses Cosmic Awareness, and is, for a time, bonded with  Rick Jones . Although the pair do not get along at first, they eventually become good friends.  Genis goes insane and threatens to destroy the universe.\n After dying and resurrecting himself\u2014with the secret aid of  Baron Helmut Zemo \u2014Genis-Vell joins the  Thunderbolts  under the name  Photon . However, in accelerating his resurrection, Zemo links Genis to the ends of time, causing a degenerative effect on the universe.  To prevent the inevitable destruction of all existence, Zemo scatters pieces of Genis-Vell's body through time and the  Darkforce  Dimension.\n \n Phyla-Vell [ edit ] \n Main article:  Phyla-Vell \n The fourth Captain Marvel is  Phyla-Vell , Genis-Vell's younger sister.  She was created by  Peter David  and  Paul Azaceta  in  Captain Marvel  (vol. 5) #16 (January 2004). Her name is a  taxonomical  pun on the part of writer Peter David. Phyla is created when Genis, an only child, recreates the universe and, in doing so, creates various anomalies which result in his mother being restored to life and his sister coming into existence. She is last seen romancing  Moondragon .\n Phyla-Vell appears in the  Annihilation  event, fighting alongside  Nova 's  United Front  in an effort to stop the destructive armies of  Annihilus . She becomes the new  Quasar  after the original one is killed by Annihilus. [13] \n Phyla has superhuman strength. She can fire energy blasts, fly, and act like an \"energy sponge\", absorbing any energy attacks directed at her and returning them as energy blasts. Phyla also has cosmic awareness and is a proficient fighter.\n Phyla later became an avatar for Oblivion and renamed herself Martyr.  She died to save her comrades in the  Guardians of the Galaxy .\n \n Khn'nr [ edit ] \n Main article:  Khn'nr \n The fifth Captain Marvel is  Khn'nr , who first appeared in  Civil War : The Return  (March 2007). He is a  Skrull  sleeper agent who is bound with Mar-Vell's DNA to lock itself into Mar-Vell's form and given technological replicas of the Kree Nega-Bands. However, his mental conditioning was botched, causing Khn'nr's personality to be erased leaving the Mar-Vell persona dominant. Though part of the  Secret Invasion , this Marvel decides to fight against the invading Skrulls. As of now, he is apparently dead.\n \n Noh-Varr [ edit ] \n Main article:  Noh-Varr \n As part of the  Dark Reign  storyline  Noh-Varr  joined the new team the  Dark Avengers  using the alias Captain Marvel. [14]  He first appears in  Marvel Boy  #1 (August 2000). He subsequently quit the team upon discovering they were all villains, at which point he was contacted by the Supreme Intelligence, given a copy of the original Captain Marvel's Nega Bands, and told he should take his place as the Kree's protector of Earth. This led to Noh-Varr taking the new code name Protector. Noh-Varr currently goes by the codename  Marvel Boy , the name he uses when he joins the  Young Avengers  and works alongside the  Inhuman Royal Family .\n \n Carol Danvers [ edit ] \n Main article:  Carol Danvers \n In July 2012, Carol Danvers, the longtime super-heroine known as  Ms. Marvel , assumed the mantle of Captain Marvel in an ongoing series written by  Kelly Sue DeConnick  with art by  Dexter Soy . Danvers dons a  jumpsuit  and explores her own past. DeConnick said at  WonderCon  2012 that her pitch for the series could be described as \"Carol Danvers as  Chuck Yeager \". She said the series would contemplate what Captain Marvel's legend means to Danvers, how she will wield it, and how the rest of the  Marvel Universe  reacts. [15] \n \n Other versions [ edit ] \n Ultimate Captain Marvel [ edit ] \n Main article:  Mahr Vehl \n The  Ultimate Marvel  miniseries  Ultimate Secret  introduces a renegade Kree who has been surgically altered to look human and sent to Earth by his people to observe its destruction by the entity  Gah Lak Tus , but defects to help the humans. He wears a specially designed combat suit that is activated by his wristwatch. The Kree technology in the suit gives Mahr Vehl increased strength and allows him to fly, create energy shields, turn invisible, view different fields of the light spectrum, and fire energy blasts through the \"totalkannon\" located on his lower arm.\n His real name is Pluskommander Geheneris Halason Mahr Vehl. As with the  Marvel Universe  character of  Mar-Vell , he assumes the identity of Dr. Philip Lawson, a scientist working on the space program. He dated the Ultimate version of  Carol Danvers .  The name 'Captain Marvel' arises as a mispronunciation by General  Nick Fury  and Carol Danvers.  Only the  Falcon  and  Thor  have bothered to learn how to pronounce his name correctly.\n \n Ruins [ edit ] \n Main article:  Ruins (comics) \n In the two-issue  Warren Ellis  mini-series  Ruins  (1995), Captain Marvel is one of the many  Kree  prisoners, in a Kree  reservation  in  Nevada .  The reservation was placed deliberately on top of a former nuclear test site. As a result of this, the majority of the Kree are suffering from various forms of  cancers  and  tumours  including Mar-Vell  who is the Kree's spokesperson. Mar-Vell gives an interview to  Daily Bugle  reporter Phil Sheldon regarding the failed Kree invasion of Earth. Mar-Vell recounts how his ship was made vulnerable to a nuclear strike when their cloaking and  shielding was affected by cosmic  radiation  from a deceased  Silver Surfer .\n \n Fantastic Four: The End [ edit ] \n Main article:  Fantastic Four: The End \n In the limited series  Fantastic Four: The End , the superheroine formerly known as  Kismet  (now under the name of Ayesha) has apparently taken over the Captain Marvel mantle in the not-too-distant future. [16] \n \n House of M [ edit ] \n Main article:  House of M \n In the alternate,  mutant -dominated world created by  Scarlet Witch , Carol Danvers ( Ms. Marvel  in mainstream continuity) uses the name Captain Marvel and is one of the few non-mutant heroes with a successful career.\n \n Marvel Zombies [ edit ] \n Main article:  Marvel Zombies \n In the mini-series  Marvel Zombies , Captain Marvel is seen sitting with Vulture and  Hercules  (both infected) waiting for Iron Man.  He is later killed by the Silver Surfer for immediate cause.\n \n Cancerverse [ edit ] \n In  The Thanos Imperative , the main villain is an alternate version of Captain Marvel called  Lord Mar-Vell . Unlike his  Earth-616  counterpart, this Mar-Vell colluded with the  Many-angled ones  to survive his cancer by actually destroying  Death  via the sacrifice of its Avatar.\n \n Amalgam Comics [ edit ] \n Main article:  Captain Marvel (Amalgam Comics) \n In two issues of  JLX  and  JLX: Unleashed , Captain Marvel combines with  Captain Marvel  to become yet another Captain Marvel, sporting the  DC Comics  lightning bolt uniform design but with the original green and white colors of the Marvel version.\n \n Age of Ultron [ edit ] \n Main article:  Age of Ultron \n In the  Age of Ultron  crossover event,  Janet van Dyne  becomes Captain Marvel in an alternate timeline created by the death of  Henry Pym . Pym is murdered by a time-travelling Wolverine to prevent the creation of  Ultron , an artificial intelligence which in a post-apocalyptic future has wiped out most of the Earth's population including most superheroes.\n \n In other media [ edit ] \n Storyboard artist for  Avengers Assemble , Ben Bates, wanted to make a Captain Marvel animated series for  Marvel Animation . It only got as far as a rough 5-minute outline available on YouTube. [17]  It would have featured the Carol Danvers Captain Marvel.  Spider-Woman  also makes an appearance in the outline. [18] \n A live-action film,  Captain Marvel , centered on the Carol Danvers version of the character, was released in March of 2019. [19]   Captain Marvel  is the twenty-first movie in the  Marvel Cinematic Universe  and stars  Brie Larson  as Carol Danvers. [20]  The movie also featured two other versions of the character, the original version Mar-Vell played by  Annette Bening  and the second version Monica Rambeau played by Akira Akbar.

While the town lies within the Reservation on most maps, the land within and around the town is owned by private landowners and the actual reservation only starts several miles to the South and East of Marvel. The area was homesteaded in the late-1800s and early-1900s with ranching, farming, and oil extraction being the main economic drivers in the region. The area around Marvel is very dry and the region becomes more and more arid as one travels towards the New Mexico border and further away from the La Plata mountains.\n The Marvel Post Office has the  ZIP Code  81329.

[2]  Marvel was founded by Benjamin F. Roden, who was the founder of the Roden Coal Company. Roden was an early business owner who was instrumental in the rapid growth of  Birmingham . He operated a grocery company in Birmingham, established the first street car system in Birmingham, and founded the city of  Avondale . [3]  The Roden Coal Company operated two mines in Marvel. [4]  The coal company also operated a company store in the community, which included a candy, drug, and tobacco department. [5]  An explosion at the mines in October 1916 killed 19 miners. [6] \n A post office operated under the name Marvel from 1907 to 1973. [7] \n \n References [ edit ] \n \n \n ^   \"Marvel\" .  Geographic Names Information System .

Bandleader  Susumu Hirasawa , feeling the group was in a state of crisis, distanced P-Model from the genre, trying to drive trend followers through rebellious episodes, and replacing their colorful clothing and equipment for a muted getup (black, white, gray and blue). At one concert, a leaflet titled \"The Point of Coming to a Concert\" was distributed while  Landsale  was looped endlessly through the PA system; the band did not play until the concertgoers started an uproar which led to a backlash against the band. [1] \n Bassist Katsuhiko Akiyama's creative position was in an opposite direction to where Hirasawa wanted to take P-Model, so he was fired from the band, and his songs were not played anymore. He was replaced by high school sophomore Tatsuya Kikuchi, a student of Hirasawa's at the Yamaha Synthesizer School. Kikuchi did not formally join the band while  Potpourri  was being recorded, leading Hirasawa and keyboardist Yasumi Tanaka to play bass parts on the album, each doing the songs they wrote. [2] \n Potpourri  has a harsher and more off-putting sound than previous albums, with P-Model employing different instruments and experimental recording techniques. Guitar is more prominent than the keyboard-centric albums from before, leaving  synthesizers  to go almost unused. Hirasawa incorporates greater antagonism into his vocals, sometimes to the point of screaming them.\n The album alienated P-Model's fanbase, leaving only a core audience that would persist with Hirasawa throughout his career.\n \n Track listing [ edit ] \nAll tracks are written by  Susumu Hirasawa , except where noted.

It was published by  Marvel Comics  in 1994.\n Set in the 1939 to 1974 time period, the series examines the  Marvel Universe , the collective setting of most of Marvel's  superhero  series, from the perspective of an  Everyman  character, news photographer  Phil Sheldon . The street-level series portrayed ordinary life in a world full of costumed superhumans, with each issue featuring events well known to readers of Marvel comics, as well as a variety of minute details and a retelling of the most famous events in the Marvel universe.\n Marvels  won multiple awards and established the careers of Busiek and Ross, who would both return to the \"everyday life in a superhero universe\" theme in the  Image Comics  (Later  Homage Comics  and currently  DC Comics ) series,  Astro City .\n Warren Ellis 's  Ruins  returned to this theme in 1995, but an actual sequel was not developed until 2008 with the release of  Marvels: Eye of the Camera .\n \n \n Contents \n \n 1   Publication history \n 2   Plot \n 3   Collected editions \n 4   Awards \n 5   Sequels \n 6   Other versions \n \n 6.1   Kingdom Come \n 6.2   Spider-Man: Blue \n \n \n 7   In other media \n \n 7.1   Television \n 7.2   Podcast \n \n \n 8   References \n 9   External links \n \n \n\n Publication history [ edit ] \n Marvels  was a four-issue  miniseries  ( cover-dated  January\u2013April 1994) by writer  Kurt Busiek , with painted art by  Alex Ross  and editing by  Marcus McLaurin . [1]  It was followed by issue #0 (August 1994) containing a 12-page story of the original 1940s  Human Torch  by Busiek and Ross, two text articles, and 18 pages of Ross superhero pinups. [2]  The series was later collected into a  trade-paperback  edition.\n \n Plot [ edit ] \n In 1939,  Jim Hammond, the original Human Torch  is created by scientist Phineas T. Horton, and the project is considered a success until the android catches on fire when air is projected into its glass chamber, only to go out when the air is gone. Horton shows his creation to the public, which is met with demands from the terrified civilians to destroy it. A dejected Horton begins to bury the android, but the chamber cracks, allowing in air and enabling the Human Torch to escape. The android describes his appearance as the beginning of a \"golden age\".\n Meanwhile, young Phil Sheldon, an aspiring photographer, and young  J. Jonah Jameson , are shocked by these \"Marvels\". Sheldon is more confused than Jameson by the spectacle and, worried, seeks the support of his fianc\u00e9e, Doris Jacquet. More unusual beings begin to appear, notably  Namor MacKenzie/Namor the Sub-Mariner , and fights erupt between him and the Human Torch. Sheldon, feeling it would be irresponsible for him to raise children in a world where these Marvels run rampant, breaks off his engagement with Doris. It is only when  Steve Rogers/Captain America  is unveiled to the world that Sheldon becomes less apprehensive about the Marvels. When  World War II  begins, Sheldon, Doris, and many others see the Marvels in  newsreels  joining forces with  the Allies , providing public reassurance. But after rekindling his romance with Doris, Sheldon hears that the Human Torch and Namor are fighting again, and the battle this time damages  New York City  landmarks. During the fight, they come near but do not directly encounter Sheldon; he is knocked out by a small chunk of masonry and permanently blinded in his left eye. Still, he has lost all fears of the Marvels and goes on to marry Doris. Sheldon becomes a  war correspondent  in Europe, reporting on the Allied Forces and the Marvels as they combat the  Nazis .\n In the mid-1960s, a married Sheldon is now the father of Beth and Jennie, and he is preparing to write a book called  Marvels . New York now has two superhero teams, the  Fantastic Four  and the  Avengers . Sheldon is excited by recent news of the return of Steve Rogers/Captain America, a hero from his youth, but the public has begun to fear  mutants , especially the mutant team known as The  X-Men . As he covers an anti-mutant mob that comes face to face with the X-Men, he hears X-Men leader  Scott Summers/Cyclops  refuse to engage with the mob, saying \"they're not worth it\" and leaving. Sheldon, unsure of their meaning, finds the words staying with him. On the positive side, some Marvels are treated as celebrities, as seen by Sheldon at the gala opening of  Alicia Masters ' sculptures. Gossip spreads over the upcoming marriage of the Fantastic Four's  Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic  and  Susan Storm/Invisible Girl . Sheldon leaves the gala and rushes home after hearing about the anti-mutant mob near there, and he finds his daughters hiding their friend, a mutant girl with a skull-like head. Sheldon sees the importance of hiding this girl, but is worried for his family. Following the wedding, mutant-hunting robots called  Sentinels  are unleashed during a television debate involving  Professor Xavier ; they malfunction and begin rampaging throughout the city. A mob forms, attacking and destroying everything in sight, with only Sheldon helping the injured. The newly repaired Sentinels stop the mob, but Sheldon returns home to find the mutant girl gone.\n As the 1960s progress, Sheldon is preoccupied with his work, to the detriment of his family. The news is filled with stories of the Avengers being declared a menace; the law going after  Tony Stark/Iron Man ; sightings of  Peter Parker/Spider-Man , who the public is unsure is a hero or a danger; and a possible  Judgement Day . The  Silver Surfer  appears to the world and defeats the Fantastic Four, heralding the appearance of  Galactus . With the city in panic, Sheldon believes the Earth will end, and he returns home to be with his family in the final moments. Suddenly, news comes that the Fantastic Four have managed to defeat Galactus, saving Earth. In the wake of the team's victory, Sheldon promises he will spend more time with his family. However, he is later disgusted by the way the public has again turned on the heroes, with one newspaper claiming the Galactus threat was a hoax. Sheldon rages at a crowd carrying on an anti-mutant conversation.\n In the 1970s, Sheldon releases his book  Marvels , and it is an instant bestseller. He remains dismayed at the public's reaction to the Marvels and is disgusted by  Daily Bugle  publisher J. Jonah Jameson's screeds against Spider-Man, who has been framed for the death of  NYPD  Captain  George Stacy . Sheldon resolves to investigate the murder and clear Spider-Man's name. While talking to a witness with  Luke Cage , he learns that not only do the police believe Spider-Man is innocent, but that they suspect  Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus  is the killer. Sheldon interviews Octavius, but he refuses to admit to the murder. Sheldon then interviews Stacy's daughter  Gwen  and develops a friendship with her. Gwen's admiration and trust in the Marvels gives Sheldon a sudden insight: the purpose of the Marvels is to protect innocents like Gwen. On his way to meet her for a session, Sheldon witnesses Gwen's kidnapping by the supervillain  Norman Osborn/Green Goblin . He follows the Goblin to the  Brooklyn Bridge  and a confrontation with Spider-Man. Watching their battle through a telephoto lens, Sheldon is certain that Spider-Man will defeat the villain and rescue the innocent victim, because that's what Marvels do. Instead, Gwen is  knocked off the bridge and killed , and Sheldon's faith in the Marvels is shattered. He plans to retire, but before he can hang up his camera, a final photo is taken of Phil, his wife, and a \"nice, normal boy\" \u2014  Danny Ketch , who, unbeknownst to Sheldon, will grow up to become the demonic hero  Ghost Rider .\n \n Collected editions [ edit ] \n In 1995,  Marvels  was compiled into a  trade paperback  that featured the Human Torch short story (2003 re-release  ISBN \u00a0 0-7851-0049-0 ). For the tenth anniversary in 2004 Marvel released a 400-page hardcover ( ISBN \u00a0 0-7851-1388-6 ). In 2008 the original was reprinted as a hardcover ( ISBN \u00a0 0-7851-2784-4 ) and softcover volume (by  Panini Comics ,  ISBN \u00a0 1-905239-97-1 ) and in 2012 as issue 15 of  The Official Marvel Graphic Novel Collection  as number 13.\n \n Awards [ edit ] \n 1994 \nSource unless otherwise stated [3] \n \n Best Finite Series  Eisner Award \n Best Painter Eisner Award, for Alex Ross \n Best Publication Design Eisner Award, for  Comicraft \n Nominated for Best Cover Artist Eisner Award, for Alex Ross \n Nominated for Best Single Issue, for  Marvels  #2 \"Monsters\" \n Sequels [ edit ] \n Marvel later published similar limited series under the \"Marvels\" header, with other writers and painters, though none of these titles were as successful as the original. They were collected in the paperback  Marvels Companion .\n In 1995, Marvel released the darker  Ruins  by writer  Warren Ellis  and painters  Cliff  and  Terese Nielsen , which was a two-issue  parallel world  series in which Sheldon explored a Marvel Universe that had gone terribly wrong.\n The 1997 miniseries  Code of Honor , written by  Chuck Dixon   and painted by Tristan Shane and  Brad Parker , had a similar approach to  Marvels , following a police officer whose job is affected by the superheroes and villains. Busiek declared he and Ross debated on doing a  Marvels  sequel, only for Ross to bail out not wanting to draw  Wolverine  and the  Punisher , and once the writer himself left the project following an argument with the editor, Busiek refitted the intended plot on \"The Dark Age\" arc of his title  Astro City . [4] \n In 2008, the long-planned direct sequel, the six-part limited series  Marvels: Eye of the Camera , began. It returns to Sheldon's perspective, after his retirement. While Ross did not return for this sequel, Busiek returned as writer, with  Roger Stern  as co-writer for issues #3\u20136, with artwork by  Jay Anacleto .\n \n \n Other versions [ edit ] \n Kingdom Come [ edit ] \n Main article:  Kingdom Come (comics) \n Ross also did the artwork for the  DC Comics  mini-series  Kingdom Come . Phil Sheldon makes a cameo at the superhero press conference held at the  headquarters of the United Nations  in  Kingdom Come #2 . He also makes an appearance in the last page of the epilogue in the  Kingdom Come  trade paperback. He is seated next to  the Spectre  in his civilian guise of  Jim Corrigan  and  Norman McCay .

Marvel UK later produced original material by British creators such as  Alan Moore ,  John Wagner ,  Dave Gibbons ,  Steve Dillon , and  Grant Morrison .\n There were a number of editors in charge of overseeing the UK editions. The first was the then 21-year-old  Tony Isabella , whose first job at Marvel was overseeing the UK weeklies, although based in the USA. He was succeeded by UK-based editors Peter L. Skingley (aka Peter Allan) and Matt Softly \u2013 both of whom were women who adopted male noms de plumes for the job. In reality they were Petra Skingley and Maureen Softly. They were then replaced by  Neil Tennant  who later found fame with the pop group the  Pet Shop Boys . Nick Laing succeeded him, but with a turbulent market seeing falls in sales was let go so that  Dez Skinn  could take over. Skinn lasted less than two years and the reins were taken over by Bernie Jaye and later  John Freeman .  Paul Neary  was editor in chief at the time Marvel decided to close the UK arm in 1995.

Titles such as  Smash!  and  Fantastic  featured a mix of Marvel reprint material and original non-Marvel work. This lasted till 1969 when the last superhero strip was removed from  Smash! , leaving no Marvel titles being reprinted in the UK at all.\n \n Origins:  MWOM  and  Spider-Man Comics Weekly [ edit ] \n In 1972, seeing a gap in the popular weekly comics market of the  UK ,  Marvel Comics  formed their own British publishing arm, Marvel UK (under the corporate name of  Magazine Management London Ltd. ). Though publishing comics in the UK for a British audience, Marvel UK was under the editorial direction of Marvel's New York offices, overseen by the young American writer/editor  Tony Isabella . [2] \n Starting with  The Mighty World of Marvel  (commonly shortened to  MWOM ), Marvel UK started with black-and-white (though early issues of  MWOM  did feature some colour) reprints of  The Hulk ,  Spider-Man , and the  Fantastic Four . A few months later  Spider-Man Comics Weekly  was released. Again this carried on reprinted American  Spider-Man  material originally started in  MWOM , with the adventures of  Thor  starting as a back-up feature. The new title allowed an entire issue of the US  The Amazing Spider-Man  to be reprinted every week in the UK publication. Both of these initial series were huge successes and became the mainstays of the Marvel UK lineup; [3]   The Mighty World Of Marvel , in one form or another, was published continuously until 1984, while the Spider-Man weekly comic (under many different name changes) would continue until 1985.\n \n Expansion [ edit ] \n In 1973 Marvel UK launched  The Avengers  - starting with material from issue 4 of the US series which reintroduced  Captain America  (issues 1-3 were reprinted in  MWOM ). The new title introduced glossy covers around a smaller 36 page comic, down from the previous 40 page format of  MWOM  and  Spider-Man Comics Weekly . Dr Strange was the back-up feature. Glossy covers were to be a distinctive feature of Marvel UK weeklies until the Marvel Revolution in 1979. The other two titles also changed to this new format. In Spiderman the decrease to 36 pages marked the reduction of Spiderman material so that now only half a US issue was reproduction in the UK weekly and  Iron Man  was added to the line up. (MWOM and SMCW had started at 40 pages but dropped to 32 before the launch of The Avengers.)\n In 1974 two new weeklies were added that departed from the usual superhero fare. These were  Dracula Lives!  and  Planet of the Apes , the latter reprinting material from the American black & white  Marvel Monster Group  brand. In 1976  Dracula Lives!   was cancelled and merged with  Planet of the Apes  as of issue 88. The Apes adventures lasted until 1977, the final months as a co-feature with the Hulk, in  MWOM  from issue 231.  The non-superhero launches continued in early 1975 as  Savage Sword of Conan  was added as a weekly title.\n In March 1975, Marvel UK launched a new weekly title called  The Super-Heroes  (simultaneously with SSOC). Although it originally starred popular characters like the  Silver Surfer  and the  X-Men , it eventually began reprinting stories starring such obscure characters such as  Doc Savage ,  Ant-Man ,  The Cat ,  Scarecrow , and  Bloodstone .\n Marvel UK's fifth superhero title, also debuting in 1975 (October), was  The Titans , which was notable for its use of a \"landscape\" orientation. Although this format allowed two pages of Marvel U.S. artwork to fit onto one (magazine-sized) Marvel UK page, reader reaction was mixed, as it made the text small and often difficult to read.  The Titans  featured well-known characters like Captain America,  Captain Marvel , the  Sub-Mariner , the  Inhumans , and  Nick Fury .\n The Super-Heroes  lasted fifty issues before being cancelled in early 1976, at which point it was merged into  Spider-Man Comics Weekly , (which changed its title to  Super Spider-Man with the Super-Heroes ). At this point the book also changed orientation to become a landscape-format comic like  The Titans . The aforementioned  Titans  title ran 58 issues until late 1976, when it too was cancelled. Towards the end of its run, the Avengers were moved over from  The Mighty World of Marvel  to be  The Titans '  lead strip. As with  The Super-Heroes , with  The Titans '  cancellation it was merged with the weekly Spider-Man comic (which changed its title again, to  Super Spider-Man and the Titans ).\n \n Tennant and Laing era [ edit ] \n Marvel UK began to establish itself as a major publisher of weekly comic titles (along with  D.C Thomson  and  IPC ) under the direction of editor-in-chief  Neil Tennant  (later one of the  Pet Shop Boys ). Tennant was responsible for  anglicising  the dialogue of the comics to suit British readers, and for indicating where women needed to be redrawn more decently for the British editions. [4] \n However, with the exception of some new covers drawn by Marvel Comics' American staff, no original material had yet been produced by Marvel UK. [3]  This changed in 1976 when  Captain Britain  Weekly  was launched, featuring a hero created for the British market.  Captain Britain Weekly  featured new stories in colour as well as reprints of  Nick Fury  and  Fantastic Four  strips as backup. [3]  It was initially a success but eventually combined with Marvel UK's  Spider-Man  reprint title  from #39.\n It was Neil Tennant's suggestion to create an original British Marvel war comic to compete with titles such as  Warlord  and  Battle Picture Weekly . While no original material was commissioned the concept of a war comic found fruition as  Fury  which ran from March to August 1977 before merging with  MWOM . It reprinted  Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos  and  Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders . [5] \n Tenant left in 1977 and was replaced by Nick Laing. In early 1978, Laing oversaw the launch of Marvel UK's  Star Wars Weekly  title, soon after  the film  was released in the UK. The weekly issues split the stories from the US monthly issues into smaller installments, and it usually took three weekly issues to complete a US monthly issue. In May 1980 the title became known as  The Empire Strikes Back Weekly , and in November 1980 it transformed into a monthly publication. Marvel UK's  Star Wars  comic also published original  Star Wars  stories by British creators as well as reprinting the US comics material. Many, but not all, of these original British stories were reprinted in the 1990s by  Dark Horse Comics . The format changed back to a weekly in June 1983 with the adaptation of  Return of the Jedi  (which also became the new name of the publication), and remained so until its last issue in 1986. Prior to the  Return of the Jedi  comic, the strips in the UK  Star Wars  comics were printed in black and white, even those taken from the American color versions. The UK comics also reprinted several other supporting strips in each issue from other Marvel properties (such as  The Micronauts ,  Tales of  the Watcher ,  Star-Lord , etc.). While the comic was in a weekly format, the supporting strips often made up the bulk of each issue.\n \n Skinn era (\"The Marvel Revolution\") [ edit ] \n By the late 1970s, sales of Marvel UK titles had begun to fall and it was on a visit to the UK that  Stan Lee  headhunted  Dez Skinn  to revamp the ailing company. Knowing Skinn had significant experience in British comic publishing, Lee gave him freedom to do what he felt best. Skinn had his own catchphrase in \"Dez Sez,\" which was inspired by Lee's catchphrases from the 1960s. [6]  Skinn set out to change Marvel UK as he saw fit, dubbing the changes \"The Marvel Revolution\". [7] [8]  Taking over in late 1978, the first major change he brought was to have original material produced by British creators. Many of these creators had already worked with Skinn on his title  The House of Hammer  a few years earlier, plus some new young talent.\n Skinn wrote: \"[T]raditional British comics were at the time selling 150,000+ a week, firm sale, no returns. If Marvel and Spider-Man could look British enough for some of that to rub off, everybody would be happy\u00a0... But fixing the covers to resemble the non-glossy generic look of weekly anthology titles was one thing\u00a0... Having \"splash\" pages and then five or six frames a page just didn't stack up against  Warlord ,  Action ,  Battle , and the rest with their nine to 12 a page.\" So the US artwork was re-sized to fit several pages onto one and emulate the look of the more established UK boys' weeklies. [9] \n Skinn reasoned that Marvel superhero weeklies had been effectively competing with each other in an already crowded market. So while the  Spider-Man Comic  was to be the flagship superhero comic (with Thor, Iron Man, Avengers, Fantastic Four, and  Nova ),  The Mighty World of Marvel  was re-launched as  Marvel Comic , in the tradition of UK boys' adventure titles.  Dracula ,  Conan the Barbarian , and  Skull the Slayer   joined (or re-joined) established strips  Daredevil  and Hulk (although the Hulk was replaced three issues after the re-launch by  Godzilla , as the Hulk left for his own title). [9] \n The Hulk was a popular character \u2013  Rampage Weekly  which starred  The Defenders  had been added to Marvel's list of publications under Tennant's editorship as a second vehicle for the green giant \u2013 and now with his own  TV series  Skinn saw the Hulk as the lead feature of another adventure style comic.  Hulk Comic  started out with originally produced Hulk stories by  Steve Dillon ,  Paul Neary , and  John Stokes , among others, which reflected the green-skinned behemoth as depicted on the TV. Skinn explained: \"As with  Marvel Comic , I was wanting an adventure anthology title more than a superhero one. Super-heroes had never been big sellers in the UK, we had plenty of legends of the past to spin fantasies about. So I went that route, picking existing Marvel characters who weren't really cut from the super-hero cloth.\" [10]  Originally produced stories were included, such as Nick Fury drawn by Steve Dillon, and  Night Raven  by  Steve Parkhouse  and  David Lloyd . Also included was the  Black Knight , a Marvel character revamped to take in  Arthurian  concepts, as well as feature the return of Captain Britain from comic book limbo. As well there was the usual US reprint material, such as  Ant-Man  and in later issues the  Beast  from  Amazing Adventures , and even The Defenders were moved in from  Rampage Monthly  to increase the dose of Hulk action (a house ad showed a stern doctor holding out a handful of pills and saying, \"Boredom is a sickness... and there's only one cure. More Hulk action!!!\").\n Arguably Skinn's most important decision was to launch  Doctor Who Weekly  in 1979. Based on the  BBC  TV series (which at that point had already been running for 16 years),  Doctor Who Weekly  featured original comics stories by  John Wagner ,  Pat Mills , and  Dave Gibbons , among many others, plus articles and features on the show itself. It proved a huge success, and by now Skinn had transformed Marvel UK back to being a major publisher of not just weekly comics but monthly titles such as  Starburst .  Starburst  had been created by Skinn before he joined Marvel UK, but was purchased by Marvel when he joined the company.\n Skinn was not happy with how creators were treated in regard to ownership of characters, [ citation needed ]  so he left Marvel UK in 1980 [11]  (eventually forming  Quality Communications  in 1982).\n \n Pocket Books [ edit ] \n In March 1980, as part of the \"Marvel Revolution\", Skinn launched the Marvel Pocket Books line with four 52-page titles. The line began with  Spider-Man , the  Fantastic Four ,  Star Heroes  (featuring TV tie-in  Battlestar Galactica  and the toy-based strip the Micronauts continued from their previous run in  Star Wars Weekly ), and  Chiller  (starring  Dracula  and the  Man-Thing  with occasional appearance from other horror-related characters). Following Skinn's belief that much of Marvel's strongest material was that published in the 1960s and early 70s, many of these titles showcased strips from that period.\n Skinn drew on the design of the traditional UK Picture Library titles which boomed in the 1960s to establish a definitive look for the Pocket Books. Skinn wrote that they \"emulated the look in their Combat Picture Library covers\u00a0... that was the look I wanted, to pull the line of pocket books together visually and make them different to any of our other titles\u00a0...\"  [12] \n The first four titles were later joined by  Hulk ,  The Titans  (reprinting the 1960s stories of Captain America, Thor and Iron Man),  Marvel Classics Comics  (featuring comic book adaptations of classic literature),  Conan , and  Young Romance . Some titles were not a success in terms of sales:  Hulk ,  Conan ,  The Titans ,  Marvel Classics Comics , and  Young Romance  were cancelled after 13 issues, while  Star Heroes  (which had replaced The Micronauts with the original  X-Men  from issue #10) was re-launched as  X-Men Pocket Book  from #14. All other Pocket Books were cancelled after issue 28 in July/August 1982.\n The Hulk strips continued in a newly launched  The Incredible Hulk Weekly  and similarly the classic Fantastic Four strips resurfaced in a weekly title in October 1982. Both of these eventually folded into  Spider-Man Comics Weekly , where the strips continued on and off until it changed into  The Spider-Man Comic , aimed at younger readers. The classic Spider-Man material continued in the first few issues of  The Daredevils .\n \n 1980s [ edit ] \n With Skinn's departure,  Bernie Jaye  took over as Marvel UK's editor-in-chief. [13]  In September 1981 Captain Britain got his own strip in the pages of  The Mighty World Of Marvel  (by then firmly established as a monthly title under the name  Marvel Superheroes ), as written by  Dave Thorpe  and drawn by  Alan Davis . (Thorpe left in 1982, to be replaced by  Alan Moore  in one of Moore's first major ongoing strips.) In October 1981, inspired by the success of its  Doctor Who  title, Marvel UK began publishing a monthly  Blake's 7  title, edited by Stewart Wales. However, as the television series itself went off the air in late 1981, the magazine itself lasted less than two years.\n Despite a flurry of new weeklies post-Skinn ( Forces in Combat ,  Marvel Team-Up ,  Future Tense  and  Valour ), by 1982 Marvel UK moved mainly to monthly titles such as  The Daredevils  (featuring Moore and Davis's  Captain Britain ). However, many of Marvel UK's titles wouldn't last long before being combined or cancelled outright due to poor sales. Jaye left the company in 1983. [13] \n In January 1985 the first issue of  Captain Britain Monthly  appeared with its titular strip written by  Jamie Delano  and drawn by Alan Davis. This title lasted 14 issues before cancellation and would prove to be Marvel UK's last major new title for several years. New material was still being produced, such as the  Zoids  stories (written by  Grant Morrison ) for  Secret Wars  and  Spider-Man and Zoids , but not on the scale or diversity previously seen.\n For the remainder of the 1980s the company published only a small handful of titles that appealed to superhero fans, but had considerable success on the UK newsstands with licensed titles such as  The Real Ghostbusters ,  ThunderCats ,  Transformers  and many others. These all featured original strips as well as some US reprints.\n Transformers , in particular, was a major seller for Marvel UK, selling 200,000 copies a week at its height. [14]  Its main writer,  Simon Furman , would eventually take over the Marvel US version of the title as well, and continues to work on the franchise to this day, though it is no longer published by either branch of Marvel Comics. The Marvel UK Transformer series, running 332 issues, is regarded as the most important collection of Transformers fiction, and on par with  Stan Lee 's runs on  Spider-Man  and the  Fantastic Four . [ citation needed ]  As such,  Transformers  remains one of Marvel UK's most important historical titles. (The Marvel UK  Transformers  series was reprinted by  Titan Books  in the 2000s with some omissions, notably all of the UK exclusive stories prior to issue 45. Although these have now been reprinted by  IDW Publishing  along with the rest of the weekly and Annual stories as part of  The Transformers Classics UK  collections.) From 1988, it was  The Real Ghostbusters  that became the top seller; it ran for 193 issues, four annuals, and a  Slimer  spinoff, and its characters were used to anchor several other titles like  Wicked! . [15]  and  The Marvel Bumper Comic . [16] [17] [18] \n In 1988, Marvel UK letterer/designer  Richard Starkings  pushed for the company to publish its own  US-format comics , [ citation needed ]  beginning with  Dragon's Claws  and  Death's Head  (a spin-off character from Marvel UK's  Transformers  title).\n The Sleeze Brothers  (1989\u20131990) was a creator-owned title by John Carnell and  Andy Lanning . It was  Steve White  who launched the first critically acclaimed volume of  Knights of Pendragon  (1990\u20131991), written by  Dan Abnett  and  John Tomlinson  with art by  Gary Erskine , which mixed superheroes and  Arthurian  myth. It also featured Captain Britain among many other Marvel Comics heroes, such as Iron Man.\n By 1990, Marvel had told its UK branch that long miniseries were too expensive and that it should produce four-issue minis (John Freeman recalled \"some legal or distribution restriction in the US on publishing three-part mini series, which the company would have preferred\") that would try out new characters. John Freeman and Dan Abnett first wanted to revive Death's Head, give a miniseris to  Strip  character Rourke, and spin off  Doctor Who Magazine' s  Abslom Daak  as an original character. This last one was dropped as Marvel felt  Doctor Who  was \"a 'dead' franchise and there was no value to Marvel in seeking to extend a brand they did not themselves own\". [19] \n \n Neary era [ edit ] \n Paul Neary  became Marvel UK editor-in-chief circa 1990, [ failed verification ]  appointed to revamp the company and make another attempt at the US market. As a stop gap, he had two short-lived reprint titles created:  Havoc  and  Meltdown  (which reprinted  Akira ). [20] \n The US-format titles began with  Death's Head II , a recreation of  Simon Furman 's cyborg bounty hunter. The titles were set in the existing Marvel Universe but with more of a focus on  cyberpunky   science fiction  and magic than the traditional superhero fare. Titles such as  Warheads  ( wormhole -hopping mercenaries),  Motormouth  (later  Motormouth and  Killpower , a streetwise girl and escaped genetically modified super assassin hop around the universe having adventures) and a second volume of  Knights of Pendragon . These were all linked by plots featuring the organization  Mys-Tech , a shadowy group of  Faustians  bent on world domination. Some of these titles were also reprinted in the UK anthology  Overkill .\n At some point during Neary's run but before the market crash, Marvel UK was running low on money. They requested an emergency meeting with  Marvel Entertainment  executives Bill Bevin and Terry Stewart to approve a \u00a31m last-ditch strategy. While they got the money, writer  Sean Howe  would later be told that Bevin was livid about being called to London for a mere one million, asking \"why are you wasting my time?\" [21] \n Neary instituted a deliberate policy to feature Marvel US guest-stars in the Marvel UK stories. However, they would only be featured on eleven pages, and these pages were designed to be able to cut from the main story; the eleven pages without the guest-star were run in  Overkill . This policy was dropped after market research showed people expected to see superheroes in Marvel (\"that included watching a group of teenagers rip Overkill apart from behind a two way mirror\", according to Freeman). [22]  Where US Marvel characters were featured, all the storylines were approved by the American editor in charge of that book. [ citation needed ]  Some were more responsive than others to the outlines, with editors such as  Bobbi Chase  offering useful feedback for Marvel UK's editors. Very few Marvel US comics referenced any of the original characters or major events that occurred within the Marvel UK comics, with an exception being  The Incredible Hulk  in August 1993. [23] \n Nevertheless, in the US, these comics were initially immensely successful, with some issues being reprinted to keep up with demand. Marvel UK massively expanded and  trading cards  were made of their characters. During this flush period,  Tom DeFalco  requested they make a new hero called  Red Squirrel  Man. [24]  An entire sub-imprint called Frontier Comics was created in 1993, patterning itself after DC's  Vertigo Comics [25]  and Marvel UK even showed up at the Lord Mayor's Show in 1993, with staff members dressed as superheroes and Death's Head II. [26] \n Despite a lineup that included  Liam Sharp ,  Simon Coleby ,  Bryan Hitch ,  Carlos Pacheco , Graham Marks,  Salvador Larroca ,  Dan Abnett  and many others, too many titles were launched too quickly in a market which was already swamped by the early 1990s comics boom. [27]  In late 1993, Marvel UK would be devastated by the comics market glut and subsequent crash; in September 29, their new Director of Sales, Lou Bank, reported that they were being hurt by \"inadequate display of product\" at retail \"[that] has hindered salethrough\" and that it was failed there was \"simply no room to display\" all the comics being made. [28] \n Dark Guard ,  Cyberspace 3000 ,  Wild Thing ,  Black Axe ,   Super Soldiers , [28]  and the entire Frontier imprint were cancelled. A large number of projects in the works, from those just proposed to some that had been solicited, were also cancelled. The  Red Mist 20:20  crossover was killed so late that  Roid Rage  #1, a  Super Soldiers  spinoff, was cancelled while at the printers. [20]  Mark Harrison's  Loose Cannons  was  cancelled shortly before it was meant to run (January 1994), despite  being almost complete; was later put online by Harrison. [29]  Paul Neary told  Comic World  that this was a \"trimming of fat\" to allow Marvel UK to focus its marketing efforts on \"our strongest characters\" and claimed the cancelled projects would see the light of day in 1994. [28]  Two titles that did still run were spinoffs of Death's Head II in November, with house ads brashly comparing them to other popular comics [30]  as part of a marketing strategy to portray the new Marvel UK as a lean, hungry company that could hold its own against larger (and implicitly duller) competition. [31] \n In 1994, Marvel UK had ceased publishing in the US market and was now only printing a handful of  titles \u2014 mostly reprints \u2014 for the  UK  market, as well as licensed titles like the long-running  Doctor Who Magazine . [32]   Death's Head II  was cancelled at #16, of which distributor Capital only sold 7,400 copies. Various creators began looking elsewhere for work and Lou Banks left for Dark Horse. [33]  Neary planned a four-title relaunch of their US format line, including  Nocturne  (an updated Night Raven),  The Golden Grenadier , [20]  and new titles for Captain Britain and Death's Head. (David Leach's proposal for Death's Head started as a  Third Doctor  joke, \"that we should completely overhaul him, reduce his power, lose the time travel aspect and set it in present day England\".) [24]  The Golden Grenadier would have been a 1950s superhero, a  grenadier guardsman  who worked for a secret organisation run by the Queen Mother. [20]  The launch never took place.\n Eventually,  Nocturne  and  ClanDestine  saw print in America while  Wild Things  (a Dark Angel/Wild Thing team-up) was published in Italy. [20] \n \n Panini takeover [ edit ] \n Main article:  Panini Comics \n With the failure of its US titles the company's assets were bought by  Panini Comics , who had been part of  Marvel Europe , and had already been reprinting American material across Europe for several years. Casualties of the merger included editor-in-chief Paul Neary and managing director  Vincent Conran .\n Thanks to this licensing deal, reprints of American Marvel Comics material continued to be published in the UK by Panini from the mid-1990s. They continued printing two existing Marvel UK titles  Astonishing Spider-Man  and  Essential X-Men  and followed the continuity of the US comics, however it was approximately two\u2013three years behind the current run in America. Each book contained approximately two or three Marvel US strips in one issue with possibly a \"classic\" comic printed as a substitute for a comic in the current run, whilst being priced at a reasonable level. In addition to this Panini continued  Doctor Who Magazine .\n In addition to reprinting the mainstream US comics, Panini started publishing a monthly (later every three weeks) oversized comic, entitled  The Spectacular Spider-Man , for younger readers to accompany  Spider-Man: The Animated Series , which began broadcasting in the UK in the mid-1990s. Initially, the stories were simply reprints of the US comics based on the series, but eventually the title moved to all-new UK-originated stories, marking the first Marvel UK material featuring classic Marvel characters to be produced since early 1994.\n Eventually, the Marvel UK logo itself was dropped. One of the final comics to have it was a licensed  Rugrats  comic in May 1996.

Artist  C. C. Beck  and writer  Bill Parker  created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in  Whiz Comics  #2 ( cover-dated  Feb. 1940), published by  Fawcett Comics . He is the alter ego of  Billy Batson , a boy who, by speaking the magic word \" SHAZAM! \" (acronym of six \"immortal elders\":  S olomon ,  H ercules ,  A tlas ,  Z eus ,  A chilles , and  M ercury ), can transform himself into a costumed adult with the powers of superhuman strength, speed, flight and other abilities. The character battles an extensive rogues' gallery, primarily archenemies  Doctor Sivana ,  Black Adam , and  Mister Mind .\n Based on book selling points, the character was the most popular superhero of the 1940s, outselling even  Superman . [2] [3]  Fawcett expanded the franchise to include other \"Marvels\", primarily  Marvel Family  associates  Mary Marvel  and  Captain Marvel Jr. , who can harness Billy's powers as well. Captain Marvel was also the first comic book superhero to be adapted into film, in a 1941  Republic Pictures   serial ,  Adventures of Captain Marvel , with  Tom Tyler  as Captain Marvel and  Frank Coghlan, Jr.  as Billy Batson.\n Fawcett ceased publishing Captain Marvel\u2013related comics in 1953, partly because of a  copyright infringement suit from DC Comics  alleging that Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman. [4]  In 1972, Fawcett licensed the character rights to DC, which by 1991 acquired all rights to the entire family of characters. DC has since integrated Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family into their  DC Universe  and has attempted to revive the property several times, with mixed success. Due to trademark conflicts over  other characters named \"Captain Marvel\"  owned by  Marvel Comics , [5]  DC has branded and marketed the character using the trademark  Shazam!  since his 1972 reintroduction. [6]   This led many to assume that \"Shazam!\" was the character's name. DC renamed the mainline version of the character as \"Shazam!\" when  relaunching  its comic book properties in 2011, [7]  and his associates became the \"Shazam Family\". [8] \n The character has been featured in two television series adaptations by  Filmation : one  live action  1970s series with actors  Jackson Bostwick  and  John Davey  portraying the character, and one  animated  1980s series. The 2019  New Line Cinema / Warner Bros.  film  Shazam!  is part of the  DC Extended Universe , with  Zachary Levi  portraying the title role and  Asher Angel  as Billy Batson.\n The character was ranked as the 55th greatest comic book character of all time by  Wizard  magazine. [9]   IGN  also ranked Captain Marvel as the 50th greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that the character will always be an enduring reminder of a simpler time. [10]   UGO Networks  ranked him as one of the top heroes of entertainment, saying, \"At his best, Shazam has always been compared to  Superman  with a sense of crazy, goofy fun.\" [11] \n \n Contents \n \n 1   Publication history \n \n 1.1   Development and inspirations \n \n 1.1.1   Introduction \n 1.1.2   Inspiration and success at Fawcett \n \n \n 1.2   Copyright infringement lawsuit and cancellation \n 1.3   Marvelman / Miracleman \n 1.4   M.

Beck . \n After the success of  National Comics ' new superhero characters  Superman  and  Batman ,  Fawcett Publications  started its own comics division in 1940, recruiting writer  Bill Parker  to create several hero characters for the first title in their line, tentatively titled  Flash Comics . Besides penning stories featuring  Ibis the Invincible ,  Spy Smasher ,  Golden Arrow ,  Lance O'Casey ,  Scoop Smith , and  Dan Dare  for the new book, Parker also wrote a story about a team of six superheroes, each possessing a special power granted to them by a mythological figure. [12] \n Fawcett Comics' executive director Ralph Daigh decided it would be best to combine the team of six into one hero who would embody all six powers. Parker responded by creating a character he called \" Captain Thunder \". [12]  Staff artist  Charles Clarence \"C. C.\" Beck  was recruited to design and illustrate Parker's story, rendering it in a direct, somewhat  cartoony  style that became his trademark. \"When Bill Parker and I went to work on Fawcett's first comic book in late 1939, we both saw how poorly written and illustrated the superhero comic books were,\" Beck told an interviewer. \"We decided to give our reader a real comic book, drawn in comic-strip style and telling an imaginative story, based not on the hackneyed formulas of the pulp magazine, but going back to the old folk-tales and myths of classic times\". [13] \n The first issue of the comic book, printed as both  Flash Comics  #1 and  Thrill Comics  #1, [14]  had a low-print run in the fall of 1939 as an  ashcan copy  created for advertising and  trademark  purposes. Shortly after its printing, however, Fawcett found it could not trademark \"Captain Thunder\", \"Flash Comics\", or \"Thrill Comics\", because all three names were already in use.  Consequently, the book was renamed  Whiz Comics , and Fawcett artist  Pete Costanza  suggested changing Captain Thunder's name to \"Captain Marvelous\", which the editors shortened to \" Captain Marvel \". The  word balloons  in the story were re-lettered to label the hero of the main story as \"Captain Marvel\".\n \n Introduction [ edit ] \n Whiz Comics  #2 ( cover-dated  Feb. 1940) was published in late 1939. The comic's lead feature introduced audiences to Billy Batson, an orphaned 12-year-old boy who, by speaking the name of the ancient wizard  Shazam , is struck by a magic lightning bolt and transformed into the adult superhero Captain Marvel. Shazam's name was an acronym derived from the six immortal elders who grant Captain Marvel his superpowers:  S olomon ,  H ercules ,  A tlas ,  Z eus ,  A chilles  and  M ercury .\n In addition to introducing the main character, his alter ego, and his mentor, Captain Marvel's first adventure in  Whiz Comics  #2 also introduced his archenemy, the evil  Doctor Sivana , and found Billy Batson talking his way into a job as an on-air radio reporter with station WHIZ. Captain Marvel was an instant success, with  Whiz Comics  #2 selling over 500,000 copies. [3]  By 1941, he had his own solo series,  Captain Marvel Adventures , the premiere issue of which was written and drawn by  Joe Simon  &  Jack Kirby . [15]  Captain Marvel continued to appear in  Whiz Comics , as well as periodic appearances in other Fawcett books, including  Master Comics .\n \n Inspiration and success at Fawcett [ edit ] \n    Whiz Comics  #22 (Oct. 1941), featuring Captain Marvel and his young alter-ego, Billy Batson. Art by  C.C. Beck . \n Inspiration for Captain Marvel came from a number of sources. His visual appearance was modeled after that of  Fred MacMurray , a popular American actor of the period, [16]  though comparisons with both  Cary Grant  and  Jack Oakie  were made as well. [17]   Fawcett Publications ' founder, Wilford H. Fawcett, was nicknamed \"Captain Billy\", which inspired the name \"Billy Batson\" as well as Marvel's title. [18]  Fawcett's earliest magazine was titled  Captain Billy's Whiz Bang , which inspired the title  Whiz Comics . [19]  In addition, Fawcett took several of the elements that had made Superman the first popular comic book superhero (super-strength and speed, science-fiction stories, a mild-mannered reporter alter ego) and incorporated them into Captain Marvel. Fawcett's circulation director Roscoe Kent Fawcett recalled telling the staff, \"Give me a Superman, only have his other identity be a 10- or 12-year-old boy rather than a man\". [20] \n Through much of the  Golden Age of Comic Books , Captain Marvel proved to be the most popular superhero character of the medium, and his comics outsold all others.  Captain Marvel Adventures  sold fourteen million copies in 1944, [21]  and was at one point being published bi-weekly with a circulation of 1.3 million copies an issue. Several issues of  Captain Marvel Adventures  included a blurb on their covers proclaiming the series the \"Largest Circulation of Any Comic Magazine\"). [3] \n The franchise was expanded to introduce spin-off characters to Captain Marvel between 1941 and 1942. [22]   Whiz Comics  #21 (1941) introduced the  Lieutenant Marvels : three other boys named \"Billy Batson\" who could also become adult superheroes.  Captain Marvel, Jr. , the alter-ego of disabled newsboy Freddy Freeman, debuted in  Whiz Comics  #25 (1941).  Mary Marvel , alter-ego of Billy's twin sister Mary Batson, first appeared in  Captain Marvel Adventures  #18 (1942). In contrast to Captain Marvel and the Lieutenants, both Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. remained kids in superhero form, and were given their own eponymous books in addition to appearing as the lead features in  Master Comics  and  Wow Comics , respectively. [22]  Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Mary Marvel appeared together as a team in another Fawcett publication,  The Marvel Family . [22]  In addition, there was a  funny animal  spin-off character,  Hoppy the Marvel Bunny , which was created in 1942 for Fawcett's  Funny Animals  comic book and later given an eponymous series as well. [22] \n With Bill Parker having been drafted into  World War II , chief writing duties on the Captain Marvel\u2013related comics stories went to  Otto Binder  by 1942. [23]  C.C. Beck remained as lead artist, and he and Binder steered the Captain Marvel stories towards a whimsical tone that emphasized comedy and fantasy elements alongside the superhero action. Other artists associated with the Marvel Family at Fawcett included  Pete Costanza ,  Mac Rayboy ,  Marc Swayze , and  Kurt Schaffenberger . [24]  Otto Binder would write over 900 of the approximately 1790 Captain Marvel\u2013related stories published by Fawcett. [23]  Several of Captain Marvel's enduring supporting characters and enemies \u2013 including the non-powered  Uncle Marvel ,  Tawky Tawny  the talking tiger, and the villains  Mister Mind  and  Black Adam  \u2013 were created by Binder during the mid-to-late 1940s. [25] \n \n Copyright infringement lawsuit and cancellation [ edit ] \n    Captain Marvel co-creator  C. C. Beck  was the chief artist on the character throughout its Golden Age run at Fawcett, and illustrated stories for the first 10 issues of DC Comics' 1970s  Shazam!  revival series. \n See also:  National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications \n Detective Comics (later known as National Comics Publications, National Periodical Publications, and today known as  DC Comics )  sued both Fawcett Comics and Republic Pictures  for  copyright infringement  in 1941, alleging that Captain Marvel was based on their character Superman. [26]  After seven years of litigation, the  National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications  case went to trial in 1948. Although the presiding judge decided that Captain Marvel was an infringement, DC was found to be negligent in copyrighting several of their  Superman  daily  newspaper strips , and it was decided that National had abandoned the Superman copyright. [27]  As a result, the initial verdict, delivered in 1951, went in Fawcett's favor.\n National appealed this decision, and Judge  Learned Hand  declared in 1952 that National's Superman copyright was in fact valid. Judge Hand did not find that the character of Captain Marvel itself was an infringement, but rather that specific stories or super feats could be infringements, and this would have to be determined in a retrial. He therefore sent the matter back to the lower court for final determination. [27] \n Instead of retrying the case, however, Fawcett settled with National out of court. The National lawsuit was not the only problem Fawcett faced in regard to Captain Marvel. While  Captain Marvel Adventures  had been the top-selling comic series during World War II, it suffered declining sales every year after 1945, and, by 1949, it was selling only half its wartime rate. [28]  Fawcett tried to revive the popularity of its Captain Marvel series in the early 1950s by introducing elements of the horror comics trend that had gained popularity at the time. [29] \n Feeling that this decline in the popularity of superhero comics meant that it was no longer worth continuing the fight, [30]  Fawcett agreed on August 14, 1953 to permanently cease publication of comics with the Captain Marvel\u2013related characters and to pay National $400,000 in damages. [4] [31]  Fawcett shut down its comics division in the autumn of 1953 and fired its comic book staff. Otto Binder and Kurt Schaffenberger ended up at DC, becoming prominent members of the creative team for the Superman-related comics from 1954 through the 1960s. [32]  Schaffenberger snuck an unauthorized cameo by Captain Marvel into a story in  Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane  #42 in 1963. [33] \n Whiz Comics  had ended with issue #155 in June 1953,  Captain Marvel Adventures  was canceled with #150 in November 1953, and  The Marvel Family  ended its run with #89 in January 1954. Hoppy the Marvel Bunny was sold to  Charlton Comics , where a few Fawcett-era stories from that strip were reprinted as  Hoppy the Magic Bunny , with all references to \"Captain Marvel\" and \"Shazam\" removed. [22] \n \n Marvelman / Miracleman [ edit ] \n Main article:  Marvelman \n In the 1950s, a small British publisher,  L. Miller and Son , published a number of  black-and-white  reprints of American comic books, including the Captain Marvel series. With the outcome of the  National v. Fawcett  lawsuit, L. Miller and Son found their supply of Captain Marvel material abruptly cut off. They requested the help of a British comic writer,  Mick Anglo , who created a thinly disguised version of the superhero called  Marvelman . Captain Marvel, Jr. was adapted to create Young Marvelman, while Mary Marvel had her gender changed to create the male Kid Marvelman. The magic word \"Shazam!\" was replaced with \"Kimota\" (\"Atomik\" spelled backwards). The new characters took over the numbering of the original Captain Marvel's United Kingdom series with issue number #25.\n Marvelman  ceased publication in 1963, but the character was revived in 1982 by writer  Alan Moore  in the pages of  Warrior Magazine . Beginning in 1985, Moore's black-and-white serialized adventures were reprinted in color by  Eclipse Comics  under the new title  Miracleman  (as  Marvel Comics  objected to the use of \"Marvel\" in the title), and continued publication in the United States after  Warrior ' s demise.  Within the  metatextual  story line of the comic series itself, it was noted that Marvelman's creation was based upon Captain Marvel comics, by both Moore and later  Marvelman/Miracleman  writer  Neil Gaiman . In 2009, Marvel Comics obtained the rights to the original 1950s  Marvelman  characters and stories, obtaining the rights to the 1980s version and those reprints in 2013. [34] [35] \n \n M. F. Enterprises [ edit ] \n Main article:  Captain Marvel (M. F. Enterprises) \n In 1966,  M. F. Enterprises  produced their own Captain Marvel: an  android  superhero from another planet whose main characteristic was the ability to split his body into several parts, each of which could move on its own. He triggered the separation by shouting \"Split!\" and reassembled himself by shouting \"Xam!\" He had a young human ward named Billy Baxton. This short-lived Captain Marvel was credited in the comic as being \"based on a character created by  Carl Burgos \". [36]   Marvel Comics  subsequently created their own character named Captain Marvel in 1967, and  Myron Fass  sued Marvel for trademark infringement. Fass accepted a $4500 settlement from Marvel, and Marvel secured the trademark of the name. [37] \n \n DC Comics revival:  Shazam! [ edit ] \n Shazam!

Looking for new properties to introduce to the DC Comics line, DC publisher  Carmine Infantino  decided to bring the Captain Marvel property back into print. On June 16, 1972, DC entered into an agreement with Fawcett to license the Captain Marvel and Marvel Family characters. [38] [31]  Because Marvel Comics had by this time established  Captain Marvel  as a comic book trademark for  their own character , created and first published in 1967, DC published their book under the name  Shazam! [5]  Infantino attempted to give the  Shazam!  book the subtitle  The Original Captain Marvel , but a  cease and desist  letter from Marvel Comics forced them to change the subtitle to  The World's Mightiest Mortal , starting with  Shazam!  #15 (December 1974). [38]  As all subsequent toys and other merchandise featuring the character have also been required to use the \"Shazam!\" label with little to no mention of the name \"Captain Marvel\", the title became so linked to Captain Marvel that many people took to identifying the character as \"Shazam\" instead of \"Captain Marvel\". [7] \n The  Shazam!  comic series began with  Shazam!  #1 (Feb. 1973). It contained both new stories and reprints from the 1940s and 1950s.  Dennis O'Neil  was the primary writer of the book. [39]  His role was later taken over by writers  Elliot S. Maggin  and  E. Nelson Bridwell .  C. C. Beck  drew stories for the first ten issues of the book before quitting due to creative differences.  Bob Oksner  and Fawcett alumnus  Kurt Schaffenberger  were among the later artists of the title. As per DC's agreement with Fawcett, DC paid Fawcett \u2013 and after 1977, its successor  CBS Publishing  \u2013 a licensing fee per issue, per page for each of the Fawcett characters who appeared, either in  Shazam!  or crossovers in other comic series. [40] \n With DC's  Multiverse  concept in effect during this time, the revived Marvel Family and related characters lived within the DC Universe on the parallel world of \"Earth-S\". [38]  The Fawcett material was still considered  canon , with the Marvel Family's 20-year layoff explained in the comic as time spent in  suspended animation  due to Doctor Sivana. [38]  While the series began with a great deal of fanfare, the book had a lackluster reception. [38]  The creators themselves had misgivings.  Beck said, \"As an illustrator, I could, in the old days, make a good story better by bringing it to life with drawings.  But I couldn't bring the new [Captain Marvel] stories to life no matter how hard I tried\". [41] \n Shazam!  was heavily  rewritten  as of issue #34 (April 1978), and Bridwell provided more realistic stories, accompanied by similar art; the first issue was drawn by  Alan Weiss  and  Joe Rubinstein , and thereafter by  Don Newton , a longtime fan of the character, [42]  and Schaffenberger. Nevertheless, the next issue was the last one, though the feature was kept alive in a back-up position in the  Dollar Comics -formatted run of  World's Finest Comics  (from #253, October/November 1978, to #282, August 1982, skipping only #271, which featured a full-length origin of the Superman-Batman team story). [43] [44]  Schaffenberger left the feature after #259, and the inking credit subsequently varied. When  World's Finest Comics  reverted to the standard 36 pages, leftover  Shazam!  material saw publication in  Adventure Comics  (#491\u2013492, September\u2013October 1982).  The remaining 11 issues of that run contained reprints, with  Shazam!  represented by mostly Fawcett-era stories (left out of  Adventure Comics  #500 and the final #503, where two features were doubled up to complete their respective story arcs).\n Outside of their regular series and features, the Marvel Family characters also appeared as guest stars in the  Justice League of America  series, in particular issues #135\u2013137 (vol. 1) for the \" Crisis on Earth-S \" story arc in 1976. [45]   Limited Collectors' Edition  #C-58 (April 1978) featured a \"Superman vs. Shazam!\" story by writer  Gerry Conway  and artists  Rich Buckler  and  Dick Giordano . [46] [47] \n Captain Marvel, and often the Marvel Family, also co-starred with Superman in several issues of  DC Comics Presents  written by  Roy Thomas . [48]  Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of  Shazam!  and the  Justice Society of America  characters. [48] [40]  The Marvels also guest starred in several issues of  All-Star Squadron , a series centered on the Justice Society and the other  Earth-2  characters written by Roy Thomas and his wife  Dann . As  All-Star Squadron  was set during World War II, several events of the comic fell concurrent with and referenced the events of the original early-1940s Fawcett stories. [49]  With their 1985  Crisis on Infinite Earths   limited series , DC fully integrated the characters into the  DC Universe .\n \n Captain Marvel in the late 1980s [ edit ] \n The first  Post- Crisis  appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986  Legends  miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the  Justice League  in  Keith Giffen 's and  J. M. DeMatteis ' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from  Legends ), he was given his own miniseries titled  Shazam!: The New Beginning . With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and  Black Adam  into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story.\n The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities. [50] \n This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology  Action Comics Weekly  #623\u2013626 (October 25, 1988 \u2013 November 15, 1988), in which a  Neo-Nazi  version of Captain Nazi was introduced. [40]  At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new  Shazam!  ongoing series. [40]  Though  New Beginning  had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas. [48]  As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new  punk -styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \"Spike\") who was not Billy's sister, and an  African-American  take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print. [40]  Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the  Shazam!  project. [40] \n Other attempts at reviving  Shazam!  were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by  John Byrne , illustrator of  Legends  and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries  The Man of Steel  (1986). [51]   None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's  War of the Gods  miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with CBS Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters. [40] \n \n The Power of Shazam! [ edit ] \n Main article:  The Power of Shazam! \n In 1991,  Jerry Ordway  was given the  Shazam!  assignment, which he pitched as a painted  graphic novel  that would lead into a series, rather than starting the series outright. [40]  Ordway both wrote and illustrated the graphic novel, titled  The Power of Shazam! , which was released in 1994.  Power of Shazam!   retconned  Captain Marvel again and gave him a revised origin, rendering  Shazam! The New Beginning  and the  Action Comics Weekly  story apocryphal while Marvel's appearances in  Legends  and  Justice League  still counted as part of the continuity. [52] \n Ordway's story more closely followed Captain Marvel's Fawcett origins, with only slight additions and changes. The graphic novel was a critically acclaimed success, leading to a  Power of Shazam!  ongoing series which ran from 1995 to 1999. [53]  That series reintroduced the Marvel Family and many of their allies and enemies into the modern-day DC Universe.\n Captain Marvel also appeared in  Mark Waid  and  Alex Ross 's critically acclaimed 1996 alternate universe  Elseworlds   Kingdom Come  miniseries. Set 20 years in the future,  Kingdom Come  features a brainwashed Captain Marvel playing a major role in the story as a mind-controlled pawn of an elderly  Lex Luthor . In 2000, Captain Marvel starred in an oversized special graphic novel,  Shazam! Power of Hope , written by  Paul Dini  and painted by  Alex Ross . [54] \n \n Early-mid-2000s:  JSA  and  52 [ edit ] \n Since the cancellation of the  Power of Shazam!  title in 1999, the Marvel Family has made appearances in a number of other DC comic books.  Black Adam became a main character in  Geoff Johns ' and  David S. Goyer 's  JSA  series, which depicted the latest adventures of the world's first superhero team, the  Justice Society of America , with Captain Marvel also briefly joining the team to keep an eye on his old nemesis. Captain Marvel also appeared in  Frank Miller 's graphic novel  Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again , the sequel to Miller's highly acclaimed graphic novel  The Dark Knight Returns , which culminated in his death. The  Superman/Shazam: First Thunder  miniseries, written by  Judd Winick  with art by  Josh Middleton , and published between September 2005 and March 2006, depicted the first post- Crisis  meeting between Superman and Captain Marvel.\n The Marvel Family played an integral part in DC's 2005/2006  Infinite Crisis  crossover, which began DC's efforts to retool the  Shazam!  franchise.  In the  Day of Vengeance  miniseries, which preceded the  Infinite Crisis  event, the wizard Shazam is killed by the  Spectre , and Captain Marvel assumes the wizard's place in the  Rock of Eternity . The Marvel Family made a handful of guest appearances in the year-long weekly maxi-series  52 , which featured Black Adam as one of its main characters.  52  introduced Adam's \"Black Marvel Family,\" which included Adam's wife  Isis , her brother  Osiris , and  Sobek .  The series chronicled Adam's attempts to reform after falling in love with Isis, only to launch the DC universe into  World War III  after she and Osiris are killed.  The Marvel Family appeared frequently in the 12-issue bimonthly painted  Justice  maxi-series by  Alex Ross ,  Jim Krueger , and  Doug Braithwaite , published from 2005 to 2007.\n \n The Trials of Shazam! [ edit ] \n Main article:  The Trials of Shazam! \n The Trials of Shazam! , a 12-issue maxi-series written by  Judd Winick  and illustrated by  Howard Porter  for the first eight issues, and by Mauro Cascioli for the remaining four, was published from 2006 to 2008.  The series redefined the  Shazam!  property with a stronger focus on magic and mysticism.   Trials of Shazam!  featured Captain Marvel, now with a white costume and long white hair, taking over the role of the wizard Shazam under the name  Marvel,  while the former Captain Marvel, Jr., Freddy Freeman, attempts to prove himself worthy to become Marvel's champion under the name  Shazam. \n In the pages of the 2007\u20132008  Countdown to Final Crisis  limited series, Black Adam gives the powerless  Mary Batson  his powers, turning her into a more aggressive super-powered figure, less upstanding than the old Mary Marvel.  By the end of the series, as well as in DC's 2008\u20132009  Final Crisis  limited series, the now black-costumed Mary Marvel, possessed by the evil New God  DeSaad , becomes a villainess, joining forces with Superman villain  Darkseid  and fighting both  Supergirl  and Freddy Freeman/Shazam.\n A three-issue arc in  Justice Society of America  (vol. 3) undid many of the  Trials of Shazam!  changes. Issues 23 through 25 of  Justice Society  featured Black Adam and a resurrected Isis defeating Marvel and taking over the Rock of Eternity. Adam and Isis recruit the now-evil Mary Marvel to help them in the ensuing fight against a now-powerless Billy Batson and the Justice Society.\n Billy and Mary Batson made a brief appearance during DC's 2009\u20132010  Blackest Night  saga in a one-shot special,  The Power of Shazam!  #48. [55]  In 2011, DC published a one-shot  Shazam!  story written by Eric Wallace, in which the still-powerless Billy and Mary help Freddy/Shazam in a battle with the demoness  Blaze . Freddy would eventually have his powers stolen by Osiris in  Titans  (vol. 2) #32 the same year. [56] \n \n The  New 52  relaunch [ edit ] \n    Alternate cover for  Justice League  (Vol. 2) #0 (Nov. 2012). Clockwise from bottom/front: Shazam!, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, Pedro Pe\u00f1a,  Freddy Freeman ,  Mary Bromfield ,  Tawny ,  Black Adam , and  Doctor Sivana . Art by  Ivan Reis . \n In 2011, DC Comics relaunched their entire comic book lineup, creating  The New 52  lineup of comics. The revamp began with a seven-issue miniseries,  Flashpoint , which features an alternate timeline in which Billy Batson, Mary Batson, and Freddy Freeman are joined by three new kids, Eugene Choi, Pedro Pe\u00f1a, and Darla Dudley, as the \"S! H! A! Z! A! M! Family.\" In this concept, all six kids say \"Shazam!\" in unison to become an alternate version of Captain Marvel named Captain Thunder. [57]  While the continuity would be altered again by the conclusion of the story, creating the \"New 52\" multiverse, the three new Shazam! kids would be reintroduced for later appearances. [58] \n One of these relaunched series,  Justice League , began featuring a  Shazam!  backup story with issue #7 in March 2012. [59]  The feature, written by  Geoff Johns  and drawn by  Gary Frank , introduces Billy Batson and his supporting cast into the new DC Universe. As part of the redesign, Captain Marvel received a new costume designed by Frank with a long cloak and hood. [60]  Johns noted that the character's place in the world will be \"far more rooted in fantasy and magic than it ever was before\". [61]  The character also was officially renamed \"Shazam\" at this time. [7]  The  Shazam!  origin story, which included two full issues in  Justice League  #0 (2012) and #21 (2013), reintroduced Billy Batson/Shazam, the Wizard, Black Adam, Tawny the tiger, and the Shazam Family (Freddy, Mary, Darla, Eugene, and Pedro) to continuity. The  Shazam!  feature concluded with  Justice League  #21, preceding DC's crossover storyline \" Trinity War \" which heavily features the Shazam mythos.\n Johns and Frank's reboot was met with both acclaim and criticism, [62] [63]  and the renaming of the hero as Shazam brought mixed reactions. [64] [65]  Johns noted that the change was made \"because that's what everyone thinks his name is anyway,\" due to the inability to use the \"Captain Marvel\" moniker on comic book covers and merchandise. [7]  In updating  Shazam!,  Johns and Frank skirted some controversy among long-time fans by introducing Billy Batson as a cynical foster child who comes to appreciate his potential as a hero and the concept of family, rather than starting him from that point as with earlier retellings. [66] [67] \n Following his appearances in the \"Trinity War\" and \" Forever Evil \" crossover storylines, Shazam appeared as a member of the Justice League from  Justice League  (vol. 2) #30 through #50 [68]  from 2014 through 2016, and also in a one-shot spinoff titled  Justice League: The Darkseid War: Shazam  (cover-dated January 2016). [69]  He also appeared as a supporting character in the  Cyborg  series as the friend of Victor Stone/Cyborg. New takes on the classic Fawcett versions of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family appeared in  Grant Morrison 's 2014 miniseries  The Multiversity  (which takes place on the parallel world of Earth-5) [70]  and in a 2015 spin-off to the  Convergence  crossover event,  Convergence: Shazam!  (which takes place on the parallel world of Earth-S) [71] \n \n DC Rebirth  and beyond [ edit ] \n Following DC's 2016  DC Rebirth  soft-relaunch event, the  Shazam!  characters were largely absent from new DC continuity, though Mary Marvel of Earth-5 appeared in  Superman  (vol. 4) #14\u201316 (2016), [72]  and Black Adam appeared in  Dark Nights: Metal  #4\u20135 (2017) to battle Wonder Woman. [73]  DC Comics and Geoff Johns have announced that Johns will write a new ongoing  Shazam!  series illustrated by  Dale Eaglesham . [74]  The series features an older and wiser Billy Batson and his foster siblings Mary, Freddy, Eugene, Pedro, and Darla exploring their powers and the Seven Magic Realms, as Doctor Sivana teams up with Mister Mind to form the  Monster Society of Evil . [75]  The first issue, featuring a  manga  backup story focused on Mary and her pet rabbit  Hoppy  by Johns and  Shazam!  fan Mayo \"SEN\" Naito, was published on December 5, 2018. [76] [74] [75] \n \n Fictional character biography [ edit ] \n Fawcett/Early DC origin [ edit ] \n Whiz Comics  #2 (Feb. 1940) introduces William Joseph \"Billy\" Batson, [77]  a homeless 12- (later 14-) year-old  newsboy [78]  who sleeps in the subway station of his home city (originally  New York City ; [79]  later referred to in DC publications as  Fawcett City [80] ). A mysterious man in a green cloak asks Billy to follow him into the subway station. A magic subway car painted in unusual shapes and colors escorts them to an underground throne room, which is inhabited by a very old man with a long beard and a white robe. As the man in green disappears, the old man on the throne explains to Billy that he is the Wizard Shazam, and has used the powers of \"the gods\" \u2013  S olomon ,  H ercules ,  A tlas ,  Z eus ,  A chilles , and  M ercury , hence the name \"Shazam\" \u2013 to fight evil for over 3,000 years. However, he has now grown too old to continue and is in need of a successor. The wizard explains that Billy was chosen due to his misfortune: he had been thrown out by a greedy uncle who stole his inheritance following the deaths of his parents (later retellings of the origin would also note that Billy was chosen for being \"pure of heart\"). [81]  Ordered by the wizard to speak the name \"Shazam,\" Billy is struck by a sudden bolt of lightning and transformed into a superpowered adult in a red costume with gold trim. [82] \nThe Wizard Shazam declares the new hero \"Captain Marvel\" and orders him to carry on his work, as a stone block suspended above his throne falls upon him, killing him as prophesied. [81]  The wizard would return \u2013 in later retellings of the origin story, immediately \u2013 as a  spirit  to serve as a mentor to Billy and Captain Marvel, summoned by lighting a torch on the wall of his lair. [81]  As a spirit, the Wizard Shazam lives at the  Rock of Eternity , a  bicone -shaped rock formation situated at the nexus of time and space. [83]  Later retellings of the Captain Marvel origin place Shazam's underground lair within the Rock. [84]  Saying the word \"Shazam\" allows Billy to summon the magic lightning and become Captain Marvel, while Captain Marvel can say the magic word himself to become Billy again. [82] \n Captain Marvel's first battle was with the mad scientist  Doctor Sivana , who becomes Captain Marvel's arch-enemy. [85]  Billy Batson becomes a reporter and host for WHIZ Radio, his career allowing him to travel and investigate criminal activity. [86]  An adult daughter of Sivana's, Beautia, becomes an unwitting love interest for the shy Captain Marvel, despite her wavering allegiance to her evil father. [87] \n While the majority of Billy's adventures feature him as a solo hero, he also fought evil on a regular basis accompanied by several other kids who share his powers to make up a superhero team called the  Marvel Family  (later referred to as the  Shazam Family  due to the issues DC Comics faced over the \"Marvel\" and \"Captain Marvel\" trademarks). The first members of the family, introduced in  Whiz Comics  #21 (Sept. 1941) and used sparingly afterwards, were the  Lieutenant Marvels : three other boys from various parts of the United States who are also named \"Billy Batson\" and discover that, if they all say \"Shazam!\" in unison, they can become adult superheroes as well.\n In  Whiz Comics  #25 (Dec. 1941), Captain Marvel saves Freddy Freeman, a boy who had been left for dead by the evil  Captain Nazi , and does for Freddy what the wizard did for him. By speaking the name \"Captain Marvel,\" Freddy can become the superpowered  Captain Marvel, Jr. . Unlike Billy, Freddy retains his 14-year-old appearance as a superhero. [78]   Captain Marvel Adventures  #18 (Dec. 1942) introduced Billy and Freddy to Mary Bromfield, a rich girl who turns out to be Billy's long-lost twin sister. By saying the magic word \"Shazam,\" Mary Bromfield becomes  Mary Marvel . [88] [89]  In the Fawcett and pre-1986 DC stories, Mary remained a teenager as Freddy did in Marvel form; Ordway's 1990s  Power of Shazam!  series made her superpowered form an adult like Billy's. [90]  The Marvel Family also included non-powered honorary members such as  Uncle Marvel , an old con man who pretended to be Mary's uncle, and Freckles Marvel, an honorary cousin.\n \n Later DC origins [ edit ] \n The basic elements of Billy Batson's and Captain Marvel's origin story remained more or less intact through 2012, with minor alterations over the years. Roy & Dann Thomas' 1987 miniseries  Shazam! The New Beginning  had a 15-year old Billy being forced to move in with Doctor Sivana, who in this version is the cruel uncle who throws Billy out into the street. [77]  Jerry Ordway's 1994  Power of Shazam!  graphic novel, which became the character's definite origin through 2011, featured a ten-year-old Billy being chosen as the Wizard Shazam's champion, due to the influence of his archaeologist parents; the mysterious stranger from magic subway car is the ghost of Billy's father in this version. [80]  Both the Thomases' and Ordway's retellings of the origin directly tie the need for the Wizard Shazam to draft a younger replacement to the coming re-emergence of  Black Adam , the wizard's first champion from the days of ancient Egypt who became evil and was due to escape thousands of years of banishment. [91] [80] \n Ordway's origin added the extra element of Black Adam's alter ego/descendant Theo Adam being the murderer of Billy's parents. [80]  The subsequent  Power of Shazam!  ongoing series features Billy, now 14, [92]  meeting his long-lost sister Mary and best friend Freddy Freeman [93]  and establishing the Marvel Family as in the Fawcett comics. [94]  The Marvels' home base of Fawcett City is depicted as a city full of old-fashioned traditions and architecture, later establishing that the Wizard Shazam placed a spell on the city (broken in later issues) that slowed time to a crawl in 1955. [95]  This phenomenon was used to explain the Marvel Family's sometimes anachronistic approaches to life and heroism compared to many of their contemporary heroes in the DC Universe. [96] \n In 2012, writer and then-DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns revised Billy Batson's origin for DC's  New 52  universe, also renaming the character's alter-ego as \"Shazam\" at this time. In his new origin story, Billy Batson is a moody and troubled 15-year-old foster child living in  Philadelphia  who has gone through several foster homes. [97]  At his newest foster home under Victor and Rosa V\u00e1zquez, Billy gains five foster siblings: \"den mother\" Mary Bromfield, trickster and pick-pocket Freddy Freeman, shy and quiet Pedro Pe\u00f1a, brainy Eugene Choi, and energetic Darla Dudley. [98]  When the evil Dr. Sivana unleashes the ancient magical warrior Black Adam from his tomb, [99]  the Wizard of the Rock of Eternity \u2013 the last of a council of beings who once controlled magic \u2013 begins abducting candidates to assess them for the job of being his champion.  He dismisses each of them for not being pure of heart. [100] [101] \n Eventually, the Wizard summons Billy, who is another unsuitable candidate, but Billy persuades the Wizard that perfectly good people \"really don't exist,\" and that, while he himself tried to be good, the world dragged Billy down to its level. In desperation and seeing the \"embers of good\" within Billy, the dying Wizard passes on his powers and teaches Billy they can be accessed through the magic word \"Shazam\" when spoken with good intentions.  After saying the magic word, Billy is struck by a bolt of lightning which transforms him into Shazam, a super-powered adult possessing super-strength, flight, and vast magical powers. The Wizard dies and Shazam is transported back to Earth, where Billy reveals his new secret to Freddy.  The two scheme to make money and score beer with Shazam's new powers, but Shazam is instead led to crime scenes where he is needed as a hero. Shazam and Freddy have a falling out when Shazam refuses to change back into Billy, and as soon as Freddy heads back home, Shazam is attacked by Black Adam. [100]  Billy is saved only by mending his relationships with Freddy, Mary, Eugene, Pedro, and Darla. When Adam again attacks, unleashing the Seven Deadly Sins on downtown Philadelphia and threatening to kill the other kids, Billy shares his powers with them, who all become magic-powered adult superheroes (except for Darla, who remains a child). [102]  Ultimately, Billy goads Adam into saying the magic word and transforming into his human form, at which point he promptly turns to dust. [102]  Although he had contemplated running away, Billy decides to stay with his new family, having learned to be a better and more open person. [102] \n Commencing the \" Trinity War \" story line, Billy flies to Black Adam's home nation of  Kahndaq  to bury Adam's remains. Shazam's entry into the country is interpreted by the locals as illegal US entry into their territory. This leads to run-ins with both the independent Justice League and the US-sponsored Justice League of America (JLA), and a series of events that see the opening of  Pandora's Box , a portal to  Earth-3  which brings the evil Justice League analogues of the  Crime Syndicate  to Earth-0. [103] [104]  Following the successful defeat of the Crime Syndicate, Shazam is inducted into the League. [105]  While still a newcomer to the league, Billy has a number of new adventures while under the mentorship of  Cyborg , who becomes one of his best friends. [106] \n After a year of living in the V\u00e1zquez home, Billy and his foster siblings have taken to having fun fighting crime around Philadelphia as the Shazam Family. While exploring the Rock of Eternity, Eugene finds a formerly-sealed off area of the Rock: an abandoned train station leading to the seven realms of an unexplored world known as the Magic Lands.\n [107] \n \n Powers and abilities [ edit ] \n While normally having no special abilities in his human persona as Billy Batson, once he says the magic word \" Shazam! \", he transforms into a full-grown man in peak physical condition endowed with multiple superpowers that rank him amongst the most powerful entities in the DC Universe. Billy is also able to share his powers with others.\n Though the link to the specific mythological figures is de-emphasized in some modern-day stories, traditionally the letters in the name  Shazam  each represent a specific superhuman ability:\n \n \n\n \n S \n for the Wisdom of  S olomon \n Billy has instant access to a vast amount of scholarly knowledge. He possesses excellent mental acuity and nearly infallible wisdom, including an innate understanding of virtually all known languages and sciences, and has a photographic memory and perfect recall, being able to retain full knowledge of all he experiences with perfect clarity. From this, he can read and decipher any coding, solve long mathematical equations instantaneously, and make intuitive guesses based on limited data, which are almost always correct. He also has a great understanding of divine phenomena in the mortal world, an uncanny awareness of his circumstances akin to clairvoyance that lets him turn disadvantages into advantages, and can provide counselling and advice in times of need. In some stories, this power also gives him the ability to hypnotize people. [108] \n \n \n H \n for the Strength of  H ercules \n The might of  Hercules  grants superhuman strength comparable to that of the legendary demigod, making him one of DC Comics' strongest characters. He is able to easily bend steel in his bare hands, do the work of several laborers in a fraction of the time, produce powerful shockwaves by clapping his hands, punch through nearly any structure, and lift and toss massive objects. This strength has been compared to that of Superman and other godlike characters. [109]  The strength of the Golden Age Captain Marvel was unlimited, [110] [111]  and the character was strong enough to move stars and planets. [110] [112] [113] [114] \n \n \n A \n for the Stamina of  A tlas \n Using  Atlas ' stamina grants near-limitless resilience. He never feels fatigued or tired and as such does not require rest or sleep. His durability lets him withstand most types of extreme physical assaults with little to no harm. Also, any physical harm he does sustain heals in seconds without any discomfort or lingering signs of the harm. He has a supernaturally-endowed  metabolism  far beyond the normal realm of human physical activities, doesn't require nourishment or even air (although he can partake of them for personal enjoyment), and he can even survive unaided in space. Sustained by the magical energies coursing through his body, Billy's empowered form never ages, making him biologically immortal and he can potentially live forever with no decline in performance so long as he remains in that form, although his normal self will continue to age. [115] \n \n \n Z \n for the Power of  Z eus \n Zeus ' power, besides fueling the magic thunderbolt that transforms Captain Marvel/Shazam, also greatly enhances Captain Marvel/Shazam's other physical and mental abilities, including his five senses, and grants him resistance against all magic spells and attacks. [116]  The hero can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or other target. [117] [118]  The magic lightning has several uses, such as creating apparatus, restoring damage done to the hero, and providing fuel for magic spells. It allows him to travel to the Rock of Eternity, thus allowing interdimensional and time travel. The current-continuity version of Shazam is able to use his lightning powers to absorb lighting and electricity, as well as conjure and generate lightning, which he can control for various uses, such as shooting energy bolts and creating electrical force fields. [100] \n \n \n A \n for the Courage of  A chilles \n This aspect is mostly psychological and spiritual in nature. The courage of  Achilles  confers the mental fortitude of the legendary Greek hero, which gives him superhuman levels of inner strength, willpower, discipline, and resolve from which to draw upon in times of hopelessness. He is constantly supported by a harmonious sense of good will and unflinching courage and he never backs down from a challenge or feels any debilitating amount of fear or despair, even in the face of the most intimidating of opponents. In some stories, it also gives him fighting skills. [119]   It also aids the hero's mental fortitude against telepathy, mind control, and other mental attacks. In some stories, being powered by Achilles also provided Billy with the hero's near-invulnerability. [120] \n \n \n M \n for the Speed of  M ercury \n By channeling  Mercury 's speed, Captain Marvel/Shazam can move at superhuman speeds comparable to the Flash and fly at supersonic speed. He is able to move at sub-light speeds in orbit and, in outer space, he can fly at trans-light speeds, although in older comics he could only leap great distances. The pre-1985 stories also let him travel to the Rock of Eternity by flying faster than the speed of light. [121] \n \n In classic stories, simply saying the word \"Shazam!\" transformed Billy into Captain Marvel/Shazam and back again; [122]  this extended to accidental utterances, recorded playbacks, and so forth. [123]  When Captain Marvel/Shazam shared his powers with his Marvel/Shazam Family teammates, it was depicted as a finite source which would be divided into halves, thirds, or further depending upon how many Marvels were super-powered at one time, and weakening them accordingly. [124] \n Captain Marvel/Shazam is not completely invulnerable. In several stories, he is shown to be susceptible to high-powered magic, [125]  which can weaken or de-power him, [125]  and, in some older stories, to significantly high voltages of lightning or electricity, which would make him revert to Billy Batson form. [126]  Despite possessing the courage of Achilles, the Fawcett Captain Marvel (though not Billy Batson) was extremely bashful and shy around attractive women, a weakness some villains came to exploit. [127] [128]  Most depictions following the  Crisis on Infinite Earths  also show his childlike innocence and immaturity to be a significant weakness. [129] \n Jerry Ordway's 1990s  The Power of Shazam!  series also gave Billy the added ability to alter Captain Marvel/Shazam's appearance to his will by visualizing alterations and then saying \"Shazam!\" [130]  Billy uses this ability to disguise himself as his \"uncle\" to work and cash checks, [131]  and to turn his Captain Marvel costume into a spacesuit for a mission in space. [132] \n In the late 2000s, when Billy replaced the wizard and took on a white costume and the name of \"Marvel\", he commanded the various magical abilities once possessed by the wizard. However, he was also required to remain on the Rock of Eternity and could only be away from it for 24 hours at a time. [133] \n Since the 2011 reboot, Shazam's powers have been slightly altered. Speaking the magic word \"Shazam\" does not cause a transformation if Billy does not want it to, and can be used to cast magic spells other than the transformation. [100]  He can share his magical powers and bestow unique powers onto members of his family, \"family\" in this case extending to chosen and foster relations, without weakening himself. [134]  Shazam also demonstrates the ability to use magic in as-yet-unexplored ways, on one occasion using it to conjure items. [135] \n \n Other versions [ edit ] \n A significant number of \"alternate\" depictions of Shazam/Captain Marvel have appeared in DC publications since the 1970s.\n \n Captain Thunder (1974) [ edit ] \n In  Superman  #276 (June 1974), Superman found himself at odds with \"Captain Thunder\", a superhero displaced from another Earth and another time.  Thunder had been magically tricked by his archenemies in the Monster League of Evil into committing evil himself, which led to his doing battle with Superman. Captain Thunder, whose name was derived from Captain Marvel's original moniker, was a thinly veiled  pastiche  of Marvel\u2014down to his similar costume, his young alter ego named \"Willie Fawcett\" (a reference to the publisher of the original Captain Marvel stories, Fawcett Comics), and a magic word (\"Thunder!\"), which was an acronym for seven entities and their respective powers. He got his power from rubbing a magic belt buckle with a thunder symbol on it and saying \"Thunder\". His powers came from Tornado (power), Hare (speed),  Uncas  (bravery), Nature (wisdom), Diamond (toughness), Eagle (flight), and Ram (tenacity). Superman held him while he used his wisdom to escape the effects of the spell.\n At the time of  Superman  #276, DC had been publishing  Shazam!  comics for two years, but had kept that universe separate from those of its other publications. The real Captain Marvel would finally meet Superman in  Justice League of America  #137, two years later (although he met  Lex Luthor  in  Shazam!  #15, November/December 1974).\n \n Captain Thunder (1982) [ edit ] \n In 1983, a proposal for an updated Captain Marvel was submitted to DC by Roy Thomas, Don Newton, and Jerry Ordway. [40]  This version of the character, to be an inhabitant of DC's main Earth-One universe, rather than the Fawcett-based Earth-S universe, would have featured an African-American version of Billy Batson named \"Willie Fawcett\" (as in the 1974 story), who spoke the magic word \"Shazam!\" to become Captain Thunder, Earth-One's Mightiest Mortal. [40]  This alternate version of the character was never used.\n \n Shazam (2001):  Just Imagine [ edit ] \n Stan Lee re-imagined the original Shazam premise by having the hero be a mild mannered Interpol agent, Robert Rogers. Teamed with the beautiful, and much tougher, fellow agent, Carla Noral, the two of them are in India searching for the megalomaniac master criminal, Gunga Kahn. This version is co-created with Gary Frank, and is based on the Bill Parker-C. C. Beck character.\n In a backup story plotted by Michael Uslan, scripted by Lee and Uslan, and drawn by Kano, an orphaned American boy in India at the same time as the adventures of Shazam heroically saves a village from starvation with the help of a local boy named Zubin Navotny. The boy's name is Billy Marvel, and he and Zubin are made honorary captains in the US Peace Corps by an Ambassador named Batson, making the boy \"Captain Marvel.\"\n \n Captain Thunder (2011):  Flashpoint [ edit ] \n The 2011  Flashpoint  comics miniseries, written by Geoff Johns with art by  Andy Kubert , featured an alternate timeline accidentally created by the  Flash , who then helped the heroes of this timeline to restore history.  One of those heroes is Captain Thunder \u2013 an alternative version of Captain Marvel who has six alter-egos, rather than one, and a scarred face as the result of a fight with  Wonder Woman , who in this timeline is a villain.\n The six children, collectively known as \"S.H.A.Z.A.M.\", each possess one of the six attributes of the power of Shazam, and must say the magic word together to become Captain Thunder. They are: Eugene Choi, who possesses the wisdom of Solomon; Pedro Pe\u00f1a, who possesses the strength of Hercules; Mary Batson, Freddy Freeman and Billy Batson, who possess the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, and the courage of Achilles, respectively; and Darla Dudley who possesses the speed of Mercury. Pedro's pet tiger Tawny also transforms into a more powerful version of himself via the magic lightning. [136] \n The six children later transform into Captain Thunder to help Flash and his allies stop the war between  Aquaman 's  Atlantean  army and Wonder Woman's  Amazonian  forces. Captain Thunder briefly fights Wonder Woman to a draw before being transformed back into the six children by Flash's accomplice  Enchantress , who is revealed to be a traitor. Before the kids can re-form Captain Thunder, Billy is stabbed by the Amazon Penthesileia and killed. [137] \n After the conclusion of the miniseries, the three new children from the  Flashpoint  timeline \u2013 Eugene, Pedro, and Darla \u2013 were incorporated into the DC Universe via the  Shazam!  backup strip in  Justice League , appearing as Billy, Mary, and Freddy's foster siblings. [58] \n \n Elseworld's Finest [ edit ] \n In the alternate universe  Elseworlds  book  Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl  (1998), the current Captain Marvel is depicted as a bald African American man; in a flashback to the older Justice Society, he appears as Captain Marvel typically has, leading to the conclusion that there were two Captain Marvels.\n \n The Dark Knight Strikes Again [ edit ] \n In the dark alternate future shown in  The Dark Knight Strikes Again , Captain Marvel is visibly aged, with receding white hair and glasses. Lex Luthor, who has captured Mary Marvel, coerces him into working for him by threatening to kill her. During an alien attack on  Metropolis , Marvel is trapped underneath a collapsing building with no way out, and admits that Billy Batson \u2013 here, clearly defined as a separate person from Marvel, rather than simply transforming into him \u2013 died eight years ago of unspecified health problems. As a result, when he next speaks his word, he will cease to exist, like any dream that no longer has anyone to remember it.  His last words to Wonder Woman are to give everyone his best, noting that it was nice existing, before he calls down his lightning and destroys himself.\n \n Superman: Distant Fires [ edit ] \n In the dark alternate future of the  Elseworlds  comic  Superman: Distant Fires  (1998), where most of humanity has been destroyed in nuclear war, an adult Billy Batson becomes obsessed with Wonder Woman when they become part of a small community of survivors of the holocaust, with most of the surviving superhumans having lost their powers or dealing with altered abilities. When the now-powerless Clark Kent joins their community, starting a relationship with Wonder Woman that includes them having a child together, Batson's resentment of Superman becomes insanity, as he provokes his transformation into Captain Marvel despite use of this power causing damage to Earth.\n \n Kingdom Come [ edit ] \n The 1996 miniseries  Kingdom Come , written by  Mark Waid  with painted art by  Alex Ross , depicts a possible future of the DC characters. In this version, Billy Batson is an adult who now matches the appearance of his superhero identity. The human hostility towards superheroes has made him uneasy, and he has not transformed into Captain Marvel for several years. Batson has become the brainwashed servant of Lex Luthor, who uses Mister Mind's mind-controlling worm offspring to keep him in check and bend him to his will. Nevertheless, Batson's potential as a being powerful enough to rival Superman causes many others to react in fear and unease when he mingles with them, believing it is a non-costumed Captain Marvel that serves Luthor. [138] \n Events finally cause him to transform into Captain Marvel, and he unleashes a force that could destroy the world. When the authorities try to stop it by dropping a nuclear bomb, Captain Marvel \u2013 spurred by Superman telling him that due to his ties to both humanity and the superhuman community, he is the only one capable of choosing which one to save \u2013 intercepts the bomb and summons his lightning to detonate it while it is still airborne, sacrificing himself to save as many lives as possible, both human and metahuman. The nuclear blast still kills a large number of heroes, but does cool the war-like attitudes of the survivors. Superman uses Marvel's cape as the symbol of a  new world order  in which humans and superhumans will now live in harmony. [139] \n \n Earth-5 [ edit ] \n In  52  #52 (May 2, 2007), a new  Multiverse  is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities, one of which is designated Earth-5.  As a result of Marvel Family foe  Mister Mind  \"eating\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-S, including the Marvel Family characters.\n The Earth-5 Captain Marvel and Billy Batson appeared, assisting Superman, in the  Final Crisis: Superman Beyond  miniseries. [140]  The miniseries established that these versions of Captain Marvel and Billy are two separate beings, and that Billy is a reporter for WHIZ Media, rather than a radio broadcaster.  The Earth-5 Captain Marvel reappeared in  Final Crisis  #7, along with an army of Supermen from across the Multiverse to prevent its destruction by Darkseid. [141]  Following  The New 52  Multiverse reboot, Earth-5 remains a Fawcett Comics\u2013inspired setting, and is spotlighted in the comic book  The Multiversity : Thunderworld #1  (Feb 2015), a modernized take on the classic Fawcett  Captain Marvel  stories from writer  Grant Morrison  and artist  Cameron Stewart . [142] [143] \n \n Justice League: Generation Lost [ edit ] \n A female version of Captain Marvel is shown as a member of an alternate-future Justice League in  Justice League: Generation Lost .  Little is revealed about her, other than the fact that her civilian name is Sahar Shazeen, and she is shown wielding a pair of swords during battle.  She and her teammates are ultimately killed by an army of  Omni Mind And Community (OMACs) . [144] \n \n Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil [ edit ] \n A Captain Marvel miniseries,  Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil , written and illustrated by  Jeff Smith  (creator of  Bone ), was published in four 48-page installments between February and July 2007.  Smith's  Shazam!  miniseries, in the works since 2003, is a more traditional take on the character, which updates and reimagines Captain Marvel's origin. [145]  Smith's story features a younger-looking Billy Batson and Captain Marvel as separate personalities, as they were in the pre-1985 stories, and features a prepubescent Mary Marvel as Captain Marvel's sidekick, instead of the traditional teen-aged or adult versions. Dr. Sivana is  Attorney General of the United States , and Mister Mind looks more like a snake than a caterpillar.\n \n Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam! [ edit ] \n An all-ages Captain Marvel comic,  Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam! , debuted in July 2008 under DC's  Johnny DC  youth-oriented imprint, and was published monthly through December 2010.  Following the lead and continuity of Smith's  Monster Society of Evil  miniseries, it was initially written and drawn by  Mike Kunkel , creator of  Herobear . [146]   Art Baltazar  and  Franco Aureliani , of  Tiny Titans , took over as writers with issue #5, with Byron Vaughns as main artist until issue #13, when  Mike Norton  assumed his place for the remainder of the series. [147]  Kunkel's version returns to the modern concept of having Captain Marvel retain Billy's personality, and also introduces new versions of Black Adam (whose alter ego, Theo Adam, is a child like Billy Batson in this version),  King Kull , the  Arson Fiend , and Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel, Jr.\n \n Mazahs [ edit ] \n Mazahs is a corrupted alternate-universe version of Shazam, introduced in the 2013\u201314  Forever Evil  DC Comics crossover event series. He is the super-powered alter-ego of  Alexander Luthor  of  Earth-3 . [148]  In the story, the  Crime Syndicate  (evil Earth-3 analogues of the Justice League) have brought Alexander Luthor, their prisoner, with them to the Prime Earth where the Justice League and other heroes reside. Prime Earth's  Lex Luthor  and  his team  sneak in to the Justice League Watchtower where the Syndicate has Alexander hostage, and remove the duct tape over his mouth, allowing Alexander to speak the magic word \"Mazahs!\" and transform into his muscular, highly powerful alter-ego. While Prime Earth's Shazam is known for sharing his powers with others, Mazahs kills other superbeings and takes their powers for his own, as when he kills the Syndicate's speedster  Johnny Quick . [149]  In the final issue of the series, it is revealed that Earth-3's Wonder Woman analogue,  Superwoman , is in a relationship with Alexander and tricked her teammates into bringing him with them. She also reveals she is carrying his child, who is prophesied to bring an end to the world. Exploiting his ability to use the powers of those he has killed, Mazahs easily takes down both the Syndicate and Luthor's team, but Prime Earth Lex Luthor (having the same voice as Mazahs) manages to call down the lightning, using a lightning-rod that Batman had retrieved to try and use against Johnny Quick based on his planned defense against the Flash, and transform Mazahs into his human form. Sealing Alexander's mouth, Lex stabs him with a knife, killing him. [150] \n Superwoman later gives birth to Mazahs's child in  Justice League  #50, and uses the baby's power-stealing abilities \u2013 inherited from his father and by her using his magic word\u2014to remove abilities the members the Prime-Earth Justice League had inherited from their time on  Apokolips  after the death of  Darkseid . The story ends with the orphaned baby having absorbed both the  Omega Effect  from Lex Luthor as well as the  Anti-Life Equation  from Justice League associate  Steve Trevor , transforming him into a resurrected\u2014yet still infantile\u2014Darkseid. [151] \n \n Injustice: Gods Among Us [ edit ] \n In the prequel comic to the 2013 video game  Injustice: Gods Among Us , Shazam joins Superman's Regime in establishing a new approach to ending crime. Similar to the Golden Age version, this Shazam is suggested to have two personalities: Billy Batson is a separate person from Shazam. In Year One he, like the Flash, is somewhat skeptical of Superman's intentions, as his actions are often immoral. Ultimately, Shazam decides to stay and support the Regime, devoted to its cause. He becomes the object of Harley Quinn's affection, being bound and gagged by her in Year Four. [152]  He is freed by  Ares  to join the Regime in combating the Amazon army and Greek gods, but just when they seem to be winning Zeus strips him of his powers, reverting him to Billy permanently. [153]  He, Harley (for trying to help him), and Wonder Woman's mother  Hippolyta  are sent to the abyss of  Tartarus  as punishment, though they escape and Billy is left out of the conflict without his powers. Eventually, Zeus is forced to return Billy's power after the  Highfather  of  New Genesis  intervenes in the conflict. In Year Five, Shazam's relationship with Harley is complicated when she confronts him about being in the Regime despite their growing tyranny. [ citation needed ]   (see the  Video Games  section for the continuation of his story in this universe) \n \n Supporting cast [ edit ] \n See also:  Marvel Family \n In the traditional  Shazam!  stories, Captain Marvel often fights evil as a member of a superhero team known as the Marvel Family, made up of himself and several other heroes: empowered by the wizard  Shazam . The main core of the Marvel Family were Captain Marvel's sister  Mary Marvel , the alter-ego of Billy Batson's twin sister Mary Batson (adopted as Mary Bromfield), and Marvel's prot\u00e9g\u00e9,  Captain Marvel, Jr. , who was the alter-ego of Billy and Mary's best friend, the disabled newsboy Freddy Freeman. Before DC's  Crisis on Infinite Earths  comic book miniseries in 1985, the Marvel Family also included part-time members such as Mary's non-powered friend \"Uncle\" Dudley ( Uncle Marvel ) and three other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (all of whose alter egos are named \"Billy Batson\") known as the  Lieutenant Marvels . A pink rabbit version of Captain Marvel,  Hoppy the Marvel Bunny , appeared in his own stories featuring a  funny-animal  cast. [154] \n In the early Fawcett stories, Billy Batson and Captain Marvel had a sidekick named  Steamboat , an  African-American  valet character who was removed from the comics by 1945 because of protests over racial stereotyping. [155]  From 1947 forward, Billy/Marvel's sidekick was  Mr. Tawky Tawny , an anthropomorphic talking tiger who works as a museum curator. [156] \n The current-continuity version of Shazam has a Shazam Family made up of his five foster siblings, with whom he shares his powers: Mary Bromfield, Freddy Freeman, Pedro Pe\u00f1a, Eugene Choi, and Darla Dudley. [102]  The latter three children were introduced in the  Flashpoint  miniseries as three of the six children sharing the powers of \"Captain Thunder\", and introduced into regular DC continuity with  Justice League  #8 in 2012. Tawny was initially depicted as a magically-charged zoo tiger in the  Justice League  backup stories. In the 2018\u2013present ongoing  Shazam!  series, a more traditional version of Tawny is a resident of The Wildlands, a magical realm inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.\n The Marvel Family's other non-powered allies have traditionally included Dr. Sivana's good-natured adult offspring, Beautia and Magnificus Sivana; WHIZ radio president and Billy's employer Sterling Morris; and Billy's girlfriend Cissie Sommerly. The 1970s  Shazam!  series also included Sunny Sparkle, the \"nicest boy in the world.\" Jerry Ordway's 1990s  Power of Shazam!  series also introduced Billy's school principal Miss Wormwood and Mary's adoptive parents Nick and Nora Bromfield. The New 52 reboot of  Shazam!  introduced the Shazam kids' foster parents, Victor and Rosa V\u00e1zquez.

Story by  Geoff Johns , art by  Gary Frank .

Zachary Levi  (right) as Shazam in the 2019 film  of the same name , with  Jack Dylan Grazer  (left) as  Freddy Freeman . \n Live-action films [ edit ] \n Film serial [ edit ] \n The first filmed adaptation of Captain Marvel was produced in 1941.  Adventures of Captain Marvel , starring  Tom Tyler  in the title role and  Frank Coghlan, Jr.  as Billy Batson, was a 12-part film  serial  produced by  Republic Pictures . This production made Captain Marvel the first superhero to be depicted in film.  The Adventures of Captain Marvel  (for which the man-in-flight effects techniques were originally developed for a Superman film serial that Republic never produced) [157]  predated  Fleischer Studios '  Superman  cartoons by six months. [157] \n \n Feature films [ edit ] \n Main article:  Shazam! (film) In 1950,  Columbia Pictures  released the comedy/mystery feature film  The Good Humor Man  with  Jack Carson ,  Lola Albright , and  George Reeves . The storyline has Carson as an ice cream vendor who also belongs to a home-grown Captain Marvel Club with some of the kids in the neighborhood. [158]  Fawcett released a  tie-in   one-shot  the same year the movie appeared,  Captain Marvel and the Good Humor Man . [159] \n Following DC's acquisition of the property, development of a  Shazam!  feature film began at  New Line Cinema  in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The project remained in development through New Line's absorption into  Warner Bros. Pictures  in 2009. [160]  In 2014,  Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson  signed on to executive produce and co-star as the villain  Black Adam . [161]  In early 2017, New Line and Johnson decided to split the  Shazam!  films into one film for Shazam! (which would instead feature Doctor Sivana as the main villain) and a solo  Black Adam  film. [162] \nNew Line's  Shazam!  film was released in 2019 by Warner Bros., and is set within Warners'  DC Extended Universe  film franchise. Directed by  David F. Sandberg  and written by Henry Gayden, the film stars  Zachary Levi  as Shazam!, [163]   Mark Strong  as  Doctor Sivana ,  Asher Angel  as Billy Batson, [164]    Jack Dylan Grazer  as Freddy Freeman, [165]  and  Djimon Hounsou  as the Wizard Shazam. [166]  Geoff Johns and Gary Frank's New 52  Shazam!  comic reboot served as the main source of inspiration for the film's plot. [167]   Shazam!  follows disaffected foster teen Billy as he simultaneously deals with the responsibility of his new power to become Shazam (with Freddy's help as his \"manager\") and his ongoing search for his birth mother. The film also introduced Billy and Freddy's foster siblings Darla (Faithe Herman) Mary ( Grace Fulton ), Eugene ( Ian Chen ), and Pedro (Jovan Armand). [168]  The other five kids become the Shazam Family at the end of the film to help Shazam battle Doctor Sivana and the Seven Deadly Sins, with  Adam Brody  as Super Hero Freddy,  Meagan Good  as Super Hero Darla,  Michelle Borth  as Super Hero Mary,  Ross Butler  as Super Hero Eugene, and  D.J. Cotrona  as Super Hero Pedro. [168] \n Produced for $98 million, [169]  the film grossed $364 million worldwide. [170]  A sequel is in development, with the cast, Sandberg, and Gayden set to return. [171]  Dwayne Johnson's  Black Adam  film is also in development at New Line, with  Adam Sztykiel  as screenwriter and Jaume Collet-Serra attached to direct. [172]  Shazam makes a brief appearance in the 2018 animated feature film  Teen Titans Go! To the Movies , adapted from Cartoon Network's  Teen Titans Go!  animated TV show.\n \n Direct-to-video animated films [ edit ] \n Captain Marvel's first appearance in  Warner Bros. Animation 's line of  DC Universe Animated Original Movies  direct-to-video films was a brief cameo in 2008's  Justice League: The New Frontier . The character had a more substantial role in the 2009 animated film  Superman/Batman: Public Enemies , based on a  Superman/Batman  comic book arc in which Marvel battles Superman under orders from United States President Lex Luthor. Captain Marvel was voiced by  Corey Burton .  An uncredited  Rachael MacFarlane  voiced Billy Batson. \n An evil version of Captain Marvel, named  Captain Super , has a minor role in the 2010 animated film  Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths .  One of the film's main villains, and Captain Super's superior, is  Superwoman  of the  Crime Syndicate  of the alternate universe Earth-3, who in this film is an evil counterpart of Mary Marvel. \n Captain Marvel appears in a animated short film entitled  Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam ,  released on the  DC Showcase Original Shorts Collection  DVD compilation as part of the  DC Universe Animated Original Movies , 2010.  Jerry O'Connell  returns from the  Justice League Unlimited  animated TV show as the voice of Captain Marvel, with Billy Batson voiced by  Zach Callison . [173] [174] [175] \n Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox , the 2013 animated adaptation of the alternate-universe comics story  Flashpoint  features Captain Thunder and the S! H! A! Z! A! M! kids as supporting characters. Apart, each child has a facet of SHAZAM's power: Eugene Choi (wisdom of  S olomon), Pedro Pe\u00f1a (strength of  H ercules), Mary Bromfield (stamina of  A tlas), Freddy Freeman (power of  Z eus), Billy Batson (courage of  A chilles), and Darla Dudley (speed of  M ercury). Together, they form Captain Thunder. Pedro Pe\u00f1a and Billy Batson are voiced by  Candi Milo  and  Jennifer Hale  respectively, with  Captain Thunder  voiced by  Steve Blum . \n In 2014, the character \u2013 now renamed Shazam \u2013 appeared in the animated film  Justice League: War . Zach Callison reprised his role as Billy Batson, and Shazam is voiced by  Sean Astin . Billy is depicted as living in a foster home with Freddy (voiced by Georgie Kidder) and Darla (voiced by  Kimberly Brooks ). A fan of high school football star Vic Stone (a.k.a.  Cyborg ), Billy gets to work alongside his hero as Shazam to help the Justice League fight  Darkseid . [176]  Shazam also appears in the sequel,  Justice League: Throne of Atlantis  (2015), voiced again by Sean Astin. [177]  He does not appear in the animated film  Justice League vs. Teen Titans  (2016), although his absence is mentioned by other Justice League members. He is again only mentioned by name in  Justice League Dark  (2017). He does not appear in  The Death of Superman  (2018), and his absence is not addressed. \n Television [ edit ] \n    Jackson Bostwick  as Captain Marvel on CBS'  Shazam!  Saturday morning TV series. \n 1970s\u20131990s [ edit ] \n Captain Marvel first came to television in 1974.  Filmation  produced  Shazam! , a live-action television show, which ran from 1974 to 1977 on  CBS . [178]  From 1975 until the end of its run, it aired as one-half of  The Shazam!/Isis Hour , featuring Filmation's own  The Secrets of Isis  as a companion program. [178] [179] \n Instead of directly following the lead of the comics, the  Shazam!  TV show took a more indirect approach to the character: Billy Batson/Captain Marvel, accompanied by an older man known simply as Mentor ( Les Tremayne ), traveled in a motor home across the US, interacting with people in different towns in which they stopped to save the citizens from some form of danger or to help them combat some form of evil. [180]   With the wizard Shazam absent from this series, Billy received his powers and counsel directly from the six \"immortal elders\" represented in the \"Shazam\" name, who were depicted via animation: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury.  Shazam!  starred  Michael Gray  as Billy Batson, with both  Jackson Bostwick  (season 1) and  John Davey  (seasons 2 and 3) as Captain Marvel. [181]  An adapted version of Isis, the heroine of  The Secrets of Isis , was introduced into DC Comics in 2006 as Black Adam's wife in the weekly comic book series  52 . \n Shortly after the  Shazam!  show ended its network run, Captain Marvel (played by Garrett Craig) appeared as a character in a pair of low-budget, live-action comedy specials, produced by  Hanna-Barbera Productions  under the name  Legends of the Superheroes  in 1979. [182]   The specials also featured  Howard Morris  as Doctor Sivana, and  Ruth Buzzi  as Aunt Minerva, marking the first appearance of those characters in film or television.  Although Captain Marvel did not appear in Hanna-Barbera's long-running concurrent  Saturday morning cartoon  series  Super Friends  (which featured many of the other DC superheroes), he did appear in some of the merchandise associated with the show. \n Filmation revisited the character three years later for an animated  Shazam!  cartoon program, which ran on  NBC  from 1981 to 1982 as part of  The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!  accompanied by  Hero High [183]  Captain Marvel and Billy Batson were both voiced by Burr Middleton. The rest of the Marvel Family joined Captain Marvel on his adventures in this series, which were more similar to his comic-book adventures than the 1970s TV show.  Dr. Sivana, Mr. Mind, Black Adam, and other familiar Captain Marvel foes appeared as enemies. [183] \n Captain Marvel and/or Billy Batson made brief \"cameo\" appearances in two 1990s TV series.  Billy has a non-speaking cameo in the  Superman: The Animated Series  episode \"Obsession\", while live actors portraying Captain Marvel make \"cameo\" appearances in both a dream-sequence within an episode of  The Drew Carey Show , and in the  Beastie Boys ' music video for \"Alive\". \n 2000s\u2013present [ edit ] \n    Captain Marvel fights Superman in the \"Clash\" episode of  Cartoon Network 's  Justice League Unlimited . \n Due to development of the  Shazam!  feature film at New Line Cinema, the rights to use the  Shazam!  characters in the  DC animated universe series  productions produced by  Bruce Timm  and/or  Paul Dini  were complicated by licensing issues. [184]  A planned Superman vs. Captain Marvel fight for the  Kids' WB  animated show  Superman: The Animated Series  circa 2000 went un-produced, as did a proposed  Shazam!  series for  Cartoon Network  pitched by Paul Dini and Alex Ross at about the same time. [185] \n Captain Marvel's first formal appearance in a DCAU production was as the main guest star character of the  Justice League Unlimited  episode \"Clash\", originally aired in 2005 on Cartoon Network. Captain Marvel was voiced by  Jerry O'Connell , and Billy Batson by  Shane Haboucha . In this episode, Captain Marvel joins the Justice League, but his positive opinions about supervillain Lex Luthor's apparent reform create a heavy strain on his relationship with Superman. This tension eventually leads to an all-out battle between Marvel and Superman when Superman believes the generator Luthor built under a city is really a bomb. [186]  Despite Shazam having magical powers (a weakness of Superman), Superman defeats him when as Marvel says \"SHAZAM!\", Superman lifts Marvel over his head, causing the lightning to hit Marvel instead and turn him into Billy. Billy tries to say the magic word, but he only makes it to the Z before Superman slaps his hand on his mouth. Superman destroys the device, but its remains are examined and it turns out to really be a generator. Despite Superman trying to apologize, Captain Marvel quits the Justice League in disgust claiming that they aren't like the heroes he admired anymore. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Captain Marvel has been only used because the clash between the two superheroes was part of a big plot organized by Lex Luthor and  Amanda Waller  to discredit Superman. \n Later, Captain Marvel made eight appearances in Cartoon Network's  Batman: The Brave and the Bold  series, which ran from 2010 to 2013. Captain Marvel voiced by  Jeff Bennett  and Billy Batson by  Tara Strong . [187]  Two second-season episodes of  Brave and the Bold  are dedicated to Captain Marvel's world and supporting cast. \"The Power of Shazam!\" featured Captain Marvel/Billy Batson alongside the Sivana Family, Black Adam, the wizard Shazam, Aunt Minerva, and Mary Batson, while \"The Malicious Mr. Mind\" featured the Marvel Family (Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr.), Sivana, Mr. Mind, and the Monster Society of Evil. [188] \n Captain Marvel also appears as a recurring character in the DC Comics-based series  Young Justice .  Captain Marvel is voiced by  Rob Lowe [189]  and later by  Chad Lowe , while Billy Batson is voiced by Robert Ochoa. Depicted as a member of the Justice League, Marvel is introduced as the team's new \"den mother\" in the episode \"Alpha Male\" after  Red Tornado 's disappearance. [190]  At various times, he sometimes joins the teenage heroes of Young Justice on their missions. [191]  Billy is 10-years-old in his season 1 appearances; 15-years-old in season 2, which takes place five years later; and 17-years-old in season 3. \n Following the character's name change, Shazam, Billy Batson, and several of their supporting characters appear in three one-minute  Shazam!   DC Nation  cartoon shorts produced in 2014 as interstitials for Cartoon Network's Saturday morning programming. [192]  Featuring designs inspired by the 1930s  Fleischer Studios   Popeye  cartoons, the three shorts \u2014 \"Courage\", \"Wisdom\", and \"Stamina\" \u2014 feature Tara Strong reprising her role as the voice of Billy Batson and  David Kaye  voicing Shazam.  Shazam! \u2013 Stamina  was nominated for the 2015  Daytime Emmy Award  for Outstanding Special Class \u2013 Short Format Daytime Program. [193] \n Shazam appears as a recurring character in the current Cartoon Network animated TV series  Justice League Action , which debuted in 2016. Shazam and Billy Batson are both voiced by  Sean Astin . Billy Batson/Shazam first appears in \"Classic Rock\" where he is summoned by the Wizard to help fight Black Adam at the Rock of Eternity. After Black Adam trapped Billy by countering the lightning that transforms him, the Wizard is thrown out of the Rock of Eternity and reluctantly gains the assistance of Batman to free Billy and defeat Black Adam. [194]  In the episode \"Abate and Switch\", Batman brings Billy Batson to where the Justice League are fighting Black Adam and Brothers Djinn members  Abnegazar, Rath, and Nyorlath . [195]  He also appears in the episode \"Captain Bamboozled\" with Uncle Dudley who gains powers as part of Mister Mxyzptlk's plot. \n Shazam also appears as a guest character in the current Cartoon Network animated TV series  Teen Titans Go!  He makes a non-speaking appearance in the season 5 episode \"Justice League's Next Top Talent Idol Star: Second Greatest Team Edition\". He later had a featured speaking role in the episode \"Little Elvis\", being voiced by John DiMaggio, [196]  with Tara Strong voicing Billy Batson. \n Video games [ edit ] \n Captain Marvel made his first official video game appearance as a playable character in  Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe , played by Stephan Scalabrino and voiced by  Kevin Delaney , for the  PlayStation 3  and  Xbox 360  game consoles.  In the story, Captain Marvel is among several DC superheroes teleported to the  Mortal Kombat  video game universe when the two universes merge, and characters from each franchise are forced to do battle. He also appears as a \"jump-in\" hero character in the  Wii / Nintendo DS  adaptations of  Batman: The Brave and the Bold , voiced by  Jeff Bennett . \n Other appearances by Captain Marvel in console games available on multiple platforms included  LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes  (voiced by  Travis Willingham ), and as a playable character in  Infinite Crisis  (voiced by  Jerry O'Connell ). [197]  He also appears in the  online role-playing game   DC Universe Online  (voiced  Shannon McCormick ). [198] \n As Shazam, the hero appears as a playable fighter in  Injustice: Gods Among Us , voiced by Joey Naber. The video game's story depicts Superman becoming a tyrant, with his own Regime of heroes against an Insurgency led by  Batman . Shazam is shown as a member of Superman's Regime, but ultimately is murdered by Superman when he questions the Man of Steel's plan to destroy Metropolis and Gotham to 'prove' to the world that his authority is needed. His death prompts the Flash to defect to the Insurgency, which gives the opposing heroes the information they need to stop the Regime. [199]  He is mentioned, but does not appear in, the sequel,  Injustice 2  on the PC and the console versions, but the movie version of Shazam is playable in the mobile version. \n Shazam reappears as a playable character in  LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham . He is able to change into Billy Batson and back at will. This time, Shazam is instantly on the console versions without downloadable content. \n Shazam appears as a playable character in  DC Unchained . \n Shazam appears in  Lego DC Super Villains , voiced by  Brandon Routh , while Billy Batson is voiced by  Zach Callison . His Earth-3 counterpart Mazahs is also a playable character as well, voiced by  Lex Lang . In the  DLC  add-on based on the 2019 film, Shazam is voiced by  Zachary Levi . \n Radio [ edit ] \n In about 1943, a radio serial of Captain Marvel was briefly broadcast (possibly by either  Mutual  or  NBC ) initially with Burt Boyar as Billy Batson. According to Boyar's faint memories in a 2011 interview, the show was initially produced in New York but after about a month relocated to Chicago; no further details about the show or transcripts of it survived. Existence of the show was confirmed by historian  Jim Harmon  via recollections of old time radio fans who recalled hearing it during original broadcasts, plus locating period program listings. [200] \n \n Comic strips [ edit ] \n In 1943, C. C. Beck and writer Rod Reed prepared seven sample installments of a comic strip, but syndicates expressed no interest in it.  Reed suspected that the DC lawsuit was the syndicates' reason, for fear of becoming parties in the ongoing litigation. [201] \n \n Cultural impact and legacy [ edit ] \n Captain Marvel vs. Superman in fiction [ edit ] \n    Captain Marvel vs. Superman on the cover of  Superman Giant  #4 (2018). Art by  Andy Kubert . \n Captain Marvel's adventures have contributed a number of elements to both comic book culture and  pop culture  in general.  The most notable contribution is the regular use of Superman and Captain Marvel as adversaries in  Modern Age  comic book stories.  The two are often portrayed as equally matched and, while Marvel does not possess Superman's  heat vision , X-ray vision or superhuman breath powers, the magic-based nature of his own powers are a weakness for Superman.\n The National Comics/Fawcett Comics rivalry was parodied in \" Superduperman \", [202]  a satirical comic book story by  Harvey Kurtzman  and  Wally Wood  in the fourth issue of  Mad  (April/May 1953).  Superduperman, endowed with muscles on muscles, does battle with Captain Marbles, a Captain Marvel caricature.  Marbles' magic word is \"SHAZOOM\", which stands for  S trength,  H ealth,  A ptitude,  Z eal,  O x (power of),  O x (power of another), and  M oney.  In contrast to Captain Marvel's perceived innocence and goodness, Marbles is greedy and money-grubbing, and a master criminal.  Superduperman defeats Marbles by tricking him into hitting himself.\n While publishing its  Shazam!  revival in the 1970s, DC Comics published a story in  Superman  #276 (June 1974) featuring a battle between the Man of Steel and a thinly disguised version of Captain Marvel called Captain Thunder, a reference to the character's original name.  He apparently battles against a Monster League, who cast a spell to make him evil, but Superman helps him break free. [203]  Two years later,  Justice League of America  #135\u2013137 presented a story arc which featured the heroes of Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-S teaming together against their enemies.  It is in this story that Superman and Captain Marvel first meet, albeit briefly.  King Kull  has caused Superman to go mad using  red kryptonite , compelling Marvel to battle him at first and subsequently restore Superman's mind with the help of lightning.\n In  Shazam!  #30 (1977), Dr. Sivana creates several steel creatures to destroy Pittsburgh's steel mills, after getting the idea from reading an issue of  Action Comics .  He finally creates a Superman robot made of a super-steel to destroy Captain Marvel. They both hit each other at the same moment, and the robot is destroyed.\n Notable later Superman/Captain Marvel battles in DC Comics include  All-New Collectors' Edition  #C-58 (1978),  All-Star Squadron  #36\u201337 (1984), and  Superman  vol. 2, #102 (1995). The Superman/Captain Marvel battle depicted in  Kingdom Come  #4 (1996) serves as the climax of that miniseries, with Marvel having been brainwashed by Lex Luthor and Mister Mind to turn against the other heroes. The \"Clash\" episode of the DC-based animated TV series  Justice League Unlimited , which includes Captain Marvel as a guest character, features a Superman/Captain Marvel fight as its centerpiece, Lex Luthor manipulating events so that Captain Marvel will perceive Superman as being prejudced against Luthor's criminal past and attacking him without provokation or evidence that Luthor has actually done anything wrong. By contrast, the depiction of the pair's first meeting in the  Superman/Shazam!: First Thunder  miniseries establishes them as firm friends and allies to the point of Superman volunteering to be Billy's mentor when he learns the boy's true age.

[3] [4] [5]  The  Marvel -themed areas or \"land\" will be developed simultaneously at the three parks and inspired by the  Marvel Cinematic Universe . They will be developed by  Walt Disney Imagineering , in collaboration with  Marvel Studios  and Marvel Themed Entertainment. [6] \n These three parks all hosted a  Marvel -themed seasonal event in the past, [7] [8] [9]  which confirmed the demand for the integration of the superheroes in the parks.\n Based on three different continents, the  Marvel -themed areas will be defined as the \"Super Hero campus\" of their specific region, that will form guests to become heroes. [10]  Each area will feature mostly different sets of attractions and entertainment, while being strongly interconnected with each other by sharing a common narrative.

The land closed on September 5, 2018 to make way for the new area. At the 2017  D23 Expo , Disney announced the Guardians of the Galaxy will be joined by  Spider-Man  and the  Avengers  as part of the new immersive Superhero area at the park. Disney has said phase one of this superhero themed area will open in 2020. Due to a 1994 contract with  Universal Parks & Resorts , Disney cannot use the \"Marvel\" name in the area name or attractions. [12] [13]  The new  Spider-Man  themed ride will use the former  It's Tough to Be a Bug!  attraction.

[17]  It will take over part of  Tomorrowland  and will be themed as the Stark Expo based in  Hong Kong , where guests are asked to join the Super Heroes in their battles. [18]  This version entered phase 2 in 2019, which includes  Ant-Man and The Wasp : Nano Battle! [19]  in the Science and Technology Pavilion of Stark Expo, along with a new retail facility and themed food. [20]  This new attraction joined the  Iron Man Experience , which opened in 2017 and took up the area where the former  Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters  attraction used to be. On top of this, there will be new attractions and other forms of entertainment added to the land up until the year 2023, when a brand new  Avengers  themed ride will open, taking over the area previously occupied by  Autopia .

[23]  It will include a re-theme of  Rock 'n' Roller Coaster avec Aerosmith  to feature  Iron Man . [4] [24]  On December 10, 2018, it was announced that  Walt Disney Studios Park  would feature a  Marvel  area similar to the one coming to  Disney California Adventure , receiving the same  Spider-Man  ride, (taking over the  Armageddon  spot, closed on April 1, 2019) and  Doctor Strange  interactive show.

In 2009,  The Walt Disney Company  acquired  Marvel Entertainment , Marvel Worldwide's parent company.\n Marvel was started in 1939 by  Martin Goodman  under a number of corporations and imprints but now known as  Timely Comics , [2]  and by 1951 had generally become known as  Atlas Comics . The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched  The Fantastic Four  and other superhero titles created by  Stan Lee ,  Jack Kirby ,  Steve Ditko  and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified as the company's primary brand.\n Marvel counts among  its characters  such well-known  superheroes  as  Spider-Man ,  Iron Man ,  Captain America ,  Thor , the  Hulk ,  Wolverine ,  Black Panther ,  Ant-Man ,  Wasp ,  Doctor Strange ,  Deadpool ,  Captain Marvel ,  Daredevil  and the  Punisher .  Superhero teams  exist such as the  Avengers , the  X-Men , the  Fantastic Four  and the  Guardians of the Galaxy  as well as  supervillains  including  Doctor Doom ,  Magneto ,  Thanos ,  Ultron ,  Doctor Octopus ,  Green Goblin ,  Red Skull ,  Loki ,  Venom ,  Galactus , and  Kingpin . Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the  Marvel Universe , with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in  New York City .

Cover art by  Frank R. Paul . \n Pulp-magazine  publisher  Martin Goodman  created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939. [4] [5]  Goodman, who had started with a  Western  pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging\u2014and by then already highly popular\u2014new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of  editor ,  managing editor , and  business manager , with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother) [6]  officially listed as publisher. [5] \n Timely's first publication,  Marvel Comics  #1 ( cover dated  Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of  Carl Burgos '  android   superhero  the  Human Torch , and the first appearances of  Bill Everett 's  anti-hero   Namor the Sub-Mariner , [7]  among other features. [4]  The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the following month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies. [8]  While its contents came from an outside packager,  Funnies, Inc. , [4]  Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor, writer-artist  Joe Simon , teamed with artist  Jack Kirby  to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes, [9]   Captain America , in  Captain America Comics  #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with sales of nearly one million. [8]  Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April 1941 or Spring 1941. [10] [2] \n While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable heroes\u2014many of which continue to appear in modern-day  retcon  appearances and flashbacks\u2014include the  Whizzer ,  Miss America , the  Destroyer , the original  Vision , and the  Angel . Timely also published one of humor cartoonist  Basil Wolverton 's best-known features, \" Powerhouse Pepper \", [11] [12]  as well as a line of children's  funny-animal  comics featuring characters like  Super Rabbit  and the duo  Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal .\n Goodman hired his wife's cousin, [13]  Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939. [14]  When editor Simon left the company in late 1941, [15]  Goodman made Lieber\u2014by then writing pseudonymously as \" Stan Lee \"\u2014interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his military service in  World War II . Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different titles.\n Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff. [2]  One of these  shell companies  through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least  Marvel Mystery Comics  #55 (May 1944). As well, some comics' covers, such as  All Surprise Comics  #12 (Winter 1946\u201347), were labeled \"A Marvel Magazine\" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961. [16] \n \n Atlas Comics [ edit ] \n Main article:  Atlas Comics (1950s) \n The post-war American comic market saw superheroes falling out of fashion. [17]  Goodman's comic book line dropped them for the most part and expanded into a wider variety of genres than even Timely had published, featuring  horror ,  Westerns , humor,  funny animal ,  men's adventure -drama, giant monster,  crime , and  war comics , and later adding  jungle  books,  romance  titles,  espionage , and even  medieval  adventure,  Bible stories  and sports.\n Goodman began using the globe logo of the Atlas News Company, the newsstand-distribution company he owned, [18]  on comics  cover-dated  November 1951 even though another company, Kable News, continued to distribute his comics through the August 1952 issues. [19]  This globe branding united a line put out by the same publisher, staff and freelancers through 59 shell companies, from Animirth Comics to Zenith Publications. [20] \n Atlas, rather than innovate, took a proven route of following  popular trends  in television and movies\u2014 Westerns  and war dramas prevailing for a time,  drive-in movie  monsters another time\u2014and even other comic books, particularly the  EC   horror  line. [21]  Atlas also published a plethora of children's and teen humor titles, including  Dan DeCarlo 's  Homer the Happy Ghost  (similar to  Casper the Friendly Ghost ) and  Homer Hooper  (\u00e0 la  Archie Andrews ). Atlas unsuccessfully attempted to revive superheroes from late 1953 to mid-1954, with the Human Torch (art by  Syd Shores  and  Dick Ayers , variously), the  Sub-Mariner  (drawn and most stories written by  Bill Everett ), and  Captain America  (writer  Stan Lee , artist  John Romita Sr. ). Atlas did not achieve any breakout hits and, according to Stan Lee, Atlas survived chiefly because it produced work quickly, cheaply, and at a passable quality. [22] \n \n    The Fantastic Four  #1 (Nov. 1961). Cover art by  Jack Kirby  (penciler) and unconfirmed inker. \n Marvel Comics [ edit ] \n The first modern comic books under the Marvel Comics brand were the  science-fiction  anthology  Journey into Mystery  #69 and the teen-humor title  Patsy Walker  #95 (both  cover dated  June 1961), which each displayed an \"MC\" box on its cover. [23]  Then, in the wake of  DC Comics ' success in reviving superheroes in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly with the  Flash ,  Green Lantern ,  Batman ,  Superman ,  wonder woman ,  green arrow  and other members of the team the  Justice League of America , Marvel followed suit. [n 1] \n In 1961, writer-editor  Stan Lee  revolutionized  superhero  comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to older readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium. Modern Marvel's first superhero team, the titular stars of  The Fantastic Four  #1 (Nov. 1961), [24]  broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling, holding grudges both deep and petty, and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status. Subsequently, Marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them, a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated. [25]  This applied to  The Amazing Spider-Man  title in particular, which turned out to be Marvel's most successful book. Its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager, something with which many readers could identify.\n Stan Lee and freelance artist and eventual co-plotter  Jack Kirby 's Fantastic Four originated in a  Cold War  culture that led their creators to revise the superhero conventions of previous eras to better reflect the psychological spirit of their age. [26]  Eschewing such comic-book tropes as secret identities and even costumes at first, having a monster as one of the heroes, and having its characters bicker and complain in what was later called a \"superheroes in the real world\" approach, the series represented a change that proved to be a great success. [27] \n Marvel often presented flawed superheroes, freaks, and misfits\u2014unlike the perfect, handsome, athletic heroes found in previous traditional comic books. Some Marvel heroes looked like villains and monsters such as the Hulk and the Thing. This  naturalistic  approach even extended into topical politics.\n Comics historian Mike Benton also noted:\n \n .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} In the world of [rival  DC Comics ']  Superman  comic books, communism did not exist. Superman rarely crossed national borders or involved himself in political disputes. [28]  From 1962 to 1965, there were more communists [in Marvel Comics] than on the subscription list of  Pravda . Communist agents attack Ant-Man in his laboratory, red henchmen jump the Fantastic Four on the moon, and  Viet Cong  guerrillas take potshots at Iron Man. [29] \n \n All these elements struck a chord with the older readers, including college-aged adults. In 1965, Spider-Man and the Hulk were both featured in  Esquire  magazine's list of 28 college campus heroes, alongside  John F. Kennedy  and  Bob Dylan . [30]  In 2009, writer Geoff Boucher reflected that,\n \n \n Superman and DC Comics instantly seemed like boring old  Pat Boone ; Marvel felt like  The Beatles  and the  British Invasion . It was Kirby's artwork with its tension and  psychedelia  that made it perfect for the times\u2014or was it Lee's bravado and melodrama, which was somehow insecure and brash at the same time? [31] \n \n \n In addition to  Spider-Man  and the Fantastic Four, Marvel began publishing further superhero titles featuring such heroes and antiheroes as the  Hulk ,  Thor ,  Ant-Man ,  Iron Man , the  X-Men ,  Daredevil , the  Inhumans ,  Black Panther ,  Doctor Strange ,  Captain Marvel  and the  Silver Surfer , and such memorable antagonists as  Doctor Doom ,  Magneto ,  Galactus ,  Loki , the  Green Goblin , and  Doctor Octopus , all existing in a shared reality known as the  Marvel Universe , with locations that mirror real-life cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n Marvel even lampooned itself and other comics companies in a  parody  comic,  Not Brand Echh  (a play on Marvel's dubbing of other companies as \"Brand Echh\", \u00e0 la the then-common phrase \"Brand X\"). [32] \n \n    The Avengers  #4 (March 1964), with (from left to right), the  Wasp ,  Giant-Man ,  Captain America ,  Iron Man ,  Thor  and (inset) the  Sub-Mariner . Cover art by  Jack Kirby  and  George Roussos . \n Cadence Industries ownership [ edit ] \n In 1968, while selling 50 million comic books a year, company founder Goodman revised the constraining distribution arrangement with Independent News he had reached under duress during the Atlas years, allowing him now to release as many titles as demand warranted. [18]  Late that year, he sold Marvel Comics and its parent company, Magazine Management, to the  Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation , with Goodman remaining as publisher. [33]  In 1969, Goodman finally ended his distribution deal with Independent by signing with  Curtis Circulation Company . [18] \n In 1971, the  United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare  approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief  Stan Lee  to do a comic book story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part  Spider-Man  story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. However, the industry's self-censorship board, the  Comics Code Authority , refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics, deeming the context of the story irrelevant. Lee, with Goodman's approval, published the story regardless in  The Amazing Spider-Man  #96\u201398 (May\u2013July 1971), without the Comics Code seal. The market reacted well to the storyline, and the CCA subsequently revised the Code the same year. [34] \n Goodman retired as publisher in 1972 and installed his son, Chip, as publisher. [35]  Shortly thereafter, Lee succeeded him as publisher and also became Marvel's president [35]  for a brief time. [36]  During his time as president, he appointed his associate editor, prolific writer  Roy Thomas , as editor-in-chief. Thomas added \"Stan Lee Presents\" to the opening page of each comic book. [35] \n \n    Howard the Duck  #8 (Jan. 1977). Cover art by  Gene Colan  and  Steve Leialoha \n A series of new editors-in-chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry. Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code published titles themed to  horror  ( The Tomb of Dracula ), martial arts ( Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu ),  sword-and-sorcery  ( Conan the Barbarian  in 1970, [37]   Red Sonja ), satire ( Howard the Duck ) and science fiction ( 2001: A Space Odyssey , \" Killraven \" in  Amazing Adventures ,  Battlestar Galactica ,  Star Trek , and, late in the decade, the long-running  Star Wars  series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its  Curtis Magazines  imprint.\n Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival  DC Comics  in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. [38]  Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount. [39] \n In 1973, Perfect Film and Chemical renamed itself as Cadence Industries and renamed Magazine Management as Marvel Comics Group. [40]  Goodman, now disconnected from Marvel, set up a new company called  Seaboard Periodicals  in 1974, reviving Marvel's old Atlas name for a new  Atlas Comics  line, but this lasted only a year and a half. [41] \nIn the mid-1970s a decline of the newsstand distribution network affected Marvel. Cult hits such as  Howard the Duck  fell victim to the distribution problems, with some titles reporting low sales when in fact the first specialty comic book stores resold them at a later date. [ citation needed ]  But by the end of the decade, Marvel's fortunes were reviving, thanks to the rise of  direct market  distribution\u2014selling through those same comics-specialty stores instead of newsstands.\n Marvel ventured into audio in 1975 with a radio series and a record, both had Stan Lee as narrator. The radio series was  Fantastic Four . The record was  Spider-Man: Rock Reflections of a Superhero  concept album for music fans. [42] \n \n    Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars  #1 (May 1984).

[43] \n Marvel held its own  comic book convention , Marvelcon '75, in spring 1975, and promised a Marvelcon '76. At the 1975 event, Stan Lee used a  Fantastic Four  panel discussion to announce that  Jack Kirby , the artist co-creator of most of Marvel's signature characters, was returning to Marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival  DC Comics . [44]  In October 1976, Marvel, which already licensed reprints in different countries, including the UK, created a superhero specifically for the British market.  Captain Britain  debuted exclusively in the UK, and later appeared in American comics. [45]  During this time, Marvel and the Iowa-based  Register and Tribune Syndicate  launched a number of syndicated  comic strips  \u2014  The Amazing Spider-Man ,  Howard the Duck ,  Conan the Barbarian , and  The Incredible Hulk . None of the strips lasted past 1982, except for  The Amazing Spider-Man , which is still being published.\n In 1978,  Jim Shooter  became Marvel's editor-in-chief. Although a controversial personality, Shooter cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, including repeatedly missed deadlines.  During Shooter's nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief,  Chris Claremont  and  John Byrne 's run on the  Uncanny X-Men  and  Frank Miller 's run on  Daredevil  became critical and commercial successes. [46]  Shooter brought Marvel into the rapidly evolving  direct market , [47]  institutionalized creator royalties, starting with the  Epic Comics  imprint for  creator-owned  material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover story arcs with  Contest of Champions  and  Secret Wars ; and in 1986 launched the ultimately unsuccessful  New Universe  line to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marvel Comics imprint.  Star Comics , a children-oriented line differing from the regular Marvel titles, was briefly successful during this period.\n \n Marvel Entertainment Group ownership [ edit ] \n In 1986, Marvel's parent,  Marvel Entertainment Group , was sold to  New World Entertainment , which within three years sold it to  MacAndrews and Forbes , owned by  Revlon  executive  Ronald Perelman  in 1989. In 1991 Perelman took MEG public. Following the rapid rise of this stock, Perelman issued a series of  junk bonds  that he used to acquire other entertainment companies, secured by MEG stock. [48] \n \n    Marvel's logo, circa 1990s. \n Marvel earned a great deal of money with their 1980s children's comics imprint  Star Comics  and they earned a great deal more money and worldwide success during the comic book boom of the early 1990s, launching the successful  2099  line of comics set in the future ( Spider-Man 2099 , etc.) and the creatively daring though commercially unsuccessful  Razorline  imprint of  superhero  comics created by novelist and filmmaker  Clive Barker . [49] [50]  In 1990, Marvel began selling  Marvel Universe Cards  with trading card maker  SkyBox International . These were collectible trading cards that featured the characters and events of the Marvel Universe. The 1990s saw the rise of  variant covers , cover enhancements,  swimsuit issues , and company-wide crossovers that affected the overall continuity of the  Marvel Universe .\n \n    Spider-Man  #1, later renamed \"Peter Parker: Spider-Man\" (August 1990; second printing). Cover art by  Todd McFarlane . \n Marvel suffered a blow in early 1992, when seven of its most prized artists \u2014  Todd McFarlane  (known for his work on  Spider-Man ),  Jim Lee  ( X-Men ),  Rob Liefeld  ( X-Force ),  Marc Silvestri  ( Wolverine ),  Erik Larsen  ( The Amazing Spider-Man ),  Jim Valentino  ( Guardians of the Galaxy ), and  Whilce Portacio  ( Uncanny X-Men ) \u2014 left to form  Image Comics [51]  in a deal brokered by  Malibu Comics ' owner  Scott Mitchell Rosenberg . [52]  Three years later Rosenberg sold Malibu to Marvel on November 3, 1994, [53] [54] [55]  who  acquired the then-leading standard for computer coloring of comic books (developed by Rosenberg) in the process, [56]  but also integrating the  Ultraverse  into Marvel's  multiverse  and ownership of the  Genesis Universe .\n In late 1994, Marvel acquired the comic book distributor  Heroes World Distribution  to use as its own exclusive distributor. [57]  As the industry's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other companies, the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America,  Diamond Comic Distributors Inc. [58] [59]  Then, by the middle of the decade, the industry had slumped, and in December 1996 MEG filed for  Chapter 11  bankruptcy protection. [48]  In early 1997, when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with Marvel [60] \u2014giving the company its own section of its comics catalog  Previews . [61] \n In 1996, Marvel had some of its titles participate in \" Heroes Reborn \", a crossover that allowed Marvel to relaunch some of its flagship characters such as the  Avengers  and the  Fantastic Four , and  outsource  them to the studios of two of the former Marvel artists turned Image Comics founders, Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld. The relaunched titles, which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct from the mainstream Marvel Universe, were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry, [62]  but Marvel discontinued the experiment after a one-year run and returned the characters to the Marvel Universe proper.\n \n Marvel Enterprises [ edit ] \n In 1997,  Toy Biz  bought Marvel Entertainment Group to end the bankruptcy, forming a new corporation,  Marvel Enterprises . [48]  With his business partner  Avi Arad , publisher  Bill Jemas , and editor-in-chief  Bob Harras , Toy Biz co-owner  Isaac Perlmutter  helped stabilize the comics line. [63] \n In 1998, the company launched the imprint  Marvel Knights , taking place just outside Marvel continuity with better production quality. The imprint was helmed by soon-to-become editor-in-chief  Joe Quesada ; it featured tough, gritty stories showcasing such characters as the  Daredevil , [64]   Inhumans  and  Black Panther .\n With the new millennium, Marvel Comics emerged from bankruptcy and again began diversifying its offerings. In 2001, Marvel withdrew from the  Comics Code Authority  and established its own  Marvel Rating System  for comics. The first title from this era to not have the code was  X-Force  #119 (October 2001). Marvel also created new  imprints , such as  MAX  (an explicit-content line) and  Marvel Adventures  (developed for child audiences). In addition, the company created an  alternate universe  imprint,  Ultimate Marvel , that allowed the company to  reboot  its major titles by revising and updating its characters to introduce to a new generation.\n Some of its characters have been turned into successful film franchises, such as the  Men in Black  movie series, starting in 1997,  Blade  movie series, starting in 1998,  X-Men  movie series, starting in 2000, and the highest grossing series  Spider-Man , beginning in 2002. [65] \n Marvel's  Conan the Barbarian  title stopped in 1993 after 275 issues. The Savage Sword of Conan magazine had 235 issues. Marvel published additional titles including miniseries until 2000 for a total of 650 issues. Conan was pick up by Dark Horse three years later. [37] \n In a cross-promotion, the November 1, 2006, episode of the CBS soap opera  The Guiding Light , titled \"She's a Marvel\", featured the character Harley Davidson Cooper (played by  Beth Ehlers ) as a superheroine named the Guiding Light. [66]  The character's story continued in an eight-page backup feature, \"A New Light\", that appeared in several Marvel titles published November 1 and 8. [67]  Also that year, Marvel created a  wiki  on its Web site. [68] \n In late 2007 the company launched  Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited , a digital archive of over 2,500 back issues available for viewing, for a monthly or annual subscription fee. [69] \n In 2009 Marvel Comics closed its Open Submissions Policy, in which the company had accepted unsolicited samples from aspiring comic book artists, saying the time-consuming review process had produced no suitably professional work. [70]  The same year, the company commemorated its 70th anniversary, dating to its inception as  Timely Comics , by issuing the one-shot  Marvel Mystery Comics  70th Anniversary Special  #1 and a variety of other special issues. [71] [72] \n \n Disney conglomerate unit (2009-present) [ edit ] \n    Writers of Marvel titles in the 2010s include (seated left to right)  Ed Brubaker ,  Christos Gage ,  Matt Fraction , and  Brian Michael Bendis . \n On August 31, 2009,  The Walt Disney Company  announced a deal to acquire Marvel Comics' parent corporation, Marvel Entertainment, for $4 billion [73]  or $4.2 billion, [74]  with Marvel  shareholders  to receive $30 and 0.745 Disney shares for each share of Marvel they own. [73]  As of 2008, Marvel and its major, longtime competitor  DC Comics  shared over 80% of the American comic-book market. [75]  As of September 2010, Marvel switched its bookstores distribution company from  Diamond Book Distributors  to  Hachette Distribution Services . [76] \n Marvel relaunched the  CrossGen  imprint, owned by  Disney Publishing Worldwide , in March 2011. [77]  Marvel and Disney Publishing began jointly publishing  Disney/Pixar Presents  magazine that May. [78] \n Marvel discontinued its  Marvel Adventures  imprint in March 2012, [79]  and replaced them with a line of two titles connected to the  Marvel Universe TV block . [80]  Also in March, Marvel announced its Marvel ReEvolution initiative that included Infinite Comics, [81]  a line of  digital comics , Marvel AR, a software  application  that provides an  augmented reality  experience to readers and  Marvel NOW! , a relaunch of most of the company's major titles with different creative teams. [82] [83]  Marvel NOW! also saw the debut of new flagship titles including  Uncanny Avengers  and  All-New X-Men . [84] \n In April 2013, Marvel and other Disney conglomerate components began announcing joint projects. With  ABC , a  Once Upon a Time  graphic novel was announced for publication in September. [85]  With Disney, Marvel announced in October 2013 that in January 2014 it would release its first title under their joint \"Disney Kingdoms\" imprint \"Seekers of the Weird\", a five-issue miniseries. [74]  On January 3, 2014, fellow Disney subsidiary  Lucasfilm  announced that as of 2015,  Star Wars  comics  would once again be published by Marvel. [86] \n Following the events of the company-wide crossover \" Secret Wars \" in 2015, a relaunched Marvel universe began in September 2015, called the  All-New, All-Different Marvel . [87] \n Marvel Legacy  was the company's Fall 2017 relaunch banner starting in September. The banner had comics with  lenticular  variant covers which required comic book stores to double their regular issue order to be able to order the variants. The owner of two Comix Experience stores complained about the set up of forcing retailers to be stuck with copies they cannot sell for the variant that they can sell. With other complaints too, Marvel did adjust down requirements for new titles no adjustment was made for any other. Thusforthly  MyComicShop.com  and at least 70 other comic book stores were boycotting these variant covers. [88]  With a handful of Marvel movies,  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ,  Logan ,  Thor: Ragnarok  and  Spider-Man: Homecoming , in theaters, none of those characters' titles were in the top 10 and even the Guardians of the Galaxy comic book series was canceled. Thus films do not affect comic book sales. [89]  Conan Properties International announced on January 12, 2018 that Conan would return to Marvel in early 2019. [37] \n On January 19, 2018, Joshua Yehl, editor of ign.com, speculated on potential changes if Disney's  proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox  went through. He expects Fox franchises licensed out to other firms would be moved to Marvel and that Fox's Marvel film properties would be treated better by the publishing division. [90]  However, Marvel had licensed  Archie Comics  to publish Marvel Digests collections for the newsstand market. [91]  While Disney has licensed  IDW Publishing  to produce the classic, all-ages Disney comics since the Marvel purchase [92]  and a Big Hero 6 comic book to go along with the  TV series  despite the fact that the  Disney movie  was based on a  Marvel Comic book .  Then on July 17, 2018, Marvel Entertainment announced the licensing of Marvel characters to IDW for a line of middle-grade reader market comic books to start publishing in November 2018. [91] \n On March 1, 2019,  Serial Box , a digital book platform, announced a partnership with Marvel. They will publish new and original stories that will be tied to a number of Marvel's popular franchises. The first series will be about the character Thor and is set to be released Summer 2019.

This head editor's title later became \"editor-in-chief\".  Joe Simon  was the company's first true chief-editor, with publisher  Martin Goodman , who had served as titular editor only and outsourced editorial operations.\n In 1994 Marvel briefly abolished the position of editor-in-chief, replacing  Tom DeFalco  with five group editors-in-chief. As Carl Potts described the 1990s editorial arrangement:\n \n In the early '90s, Marvel had so many titles that there were three Executive Editors, each overseeing approximately 1/3 of the line.  Bob Budiansky  was the third Executive Editor [following the previously appointed  Mark Gruenwald  and Potts]. We all answered to Editor-in-Chief Tom DeFalco and Publisher  Mike Hobson . All three Executive Editors decided not to add our names to the already crowded credits on the Marvel titles. Therefore it wasn't easy for readers to tell which titles were produced by which Executive Editor \u2026 In late '94, Marvel reorganized into a number of different publishing divisions, each with its own Editor-in-Chief. [99] \n \n Marvel reinstated the overall editor-in-chief position in 1995 with  Bob Harras .\n \n \n\n \n \n \n Editor \n Martin Goodman  (1939\u20131940; titular only) [5] \n Joe Simon  (1939\u20131941) \n Stan Lee  (1941\u20131942) \n Vincent Fago  (acting editor during Lee's military service) (1942\u20131945) \n Stan Lee (1945\u20131972) \n Roy Thomas  (1972\u20131974) \n Len Wein  (1974\u20131975) \n Marv Wolfman  ( black-and-white  magazines 1974\u20131975, entire line 1975\u20131976) \n Gerry Conway  (1976) \n Archie Goodwin  (1976\u20131978) \n  \n \n \n \n Editor-in-chief \n Jim Shooter  (1978\u20131987) \n Tom DeFalco  (1987\u20131994) \n No overall ; separate group editors-in-chief (1994\u20131995)\n Mark Gruenwald , Universe ( Avengers  &  Cosmic ) \n Bob Harras ,  Mutant \n Bob Budiansky ,  Spider-Man \n Bobbie Chase ,  Marvel Edge \n Carl Potts ,  Epic Comics  & general entertainment [99] \n Bob Harras  (1995\u20132000) \n Joe Quesada  (2000\u20132011) \n Axel Alonso  (2011\u20132017) \n C.

The title of associate editor later was revived under the editor-in-chief as an editorial position in charge of few titles under the direction of an editor and without an assistant editor.\n \n Associate Editor \n Jim Shooter , January 5, 1976 \u2013 January 2, 1978 [101] \n\n Executive Editor \n \n Tom DeFalco , 1987 \n Mark Gruenwald , 1987\u20131994, senior editor: 1995\u20131996 \n Carl Potts , in charge of  Epic Comics  1989\u20131994, [99]  1995\u20131996 \n Bob Budiansky , early '90s \u2013 1994 [99] \n Bobbie Chase , 1995\u20132001 \n Tom Brevoort , 2007\u20132011 [102] \n Axel Alonso , 2010 \u2013 January 2011 [103] \n \n Ownership [ edit ] \n Martin Goodman  (1939\u20131968) \n Parent corporation \n Magazine Management Co.

Some of these adaptations were produced by Marvel Comics and its sister company,  Marvel Studios , while others were produced by companies licensing Marvel material.\n \n Games [ edit ] \n In June 1993, Marvel issued its collectable caps for  milk caps game  under the Hero Caps brand. [109]  In 2014, the  Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers  Japanese TV series was launched together with a collectible game called Bachicombat, a game similar to the milk caps game, by  Bandai .

TSR then released in 1998 the  Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game  which used a different system, the card-based SAGA system, than their first game. In 2003 Marvel Publishing published its own role-playing game, the  Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game , that used a diceless stone pool system. [111]  In August 2011  Margaret Weis Productions  announced it was developing a  tabletop role-playing game  based on the Marvel universe, set for release in February 2012 using its house Cortex Plus RPG system.

Various publishers took up the licenses from 1978 to 2002. Also, with the various licensed films being released beginning in 1997, various publishers put out movie  novelizations . [114]  In 2003, following publication of the prose  young adult novel   Mary Jane , starring  Mary Jane Watson  from the  Spider-Man  mythos, Marvel announced the formation of the publishing  imprint   Marvel Press . [115]  However, Marvel moved back to licensing with Pocket Books from 2005 to 2008. [114]   With few books issued under the imprint, Marvel and  Disney Books Group  relaunched Marvel Press in 2011 with the Marvel Origin Storybooks line. [116] \n \n Television programs [ edit ] \n Main article:  List of television series based on Marvel Comics \n Many television series, both live-action and animated, have based their productions on Marvel Comics characters. These include series for popular characters such as Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, the Avengers, the X-Men, Fantastic Four, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, the Punisher, the Defenders, S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter, Deadpool, Legion, and others. Additionally, a handful of television movies, usually also pilots, based on Marvel Comics characters have been made.\n \n Theme parks [ edit ] \n Marvel has licensed its characters for theme parks and attractions, including  Marvel Super Hero Island  at  Universal Orlando 's  Islands of Adventure [117]  in  Orlando, Florida , which includes rides based on their iconic characters and costumed performers, as well as  The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man  ride cloned from Islands of Adventure to  Universal Studios Japan . [118] \n Years after Disney purchased Marvel in late 2009,  Walt Disney Parks and Resorts  plans on creating original Marvel attractions at their theme parks, [119] [120]  with  Hong Kong Disneyland  becoming the first Disney theme park to feature a  Marvel attraction . [121] [122]  Due to the licensing agreement with Universal Studios, signed prior to Disney's purchase of Marvel, Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disney Resort are barred from having Marvel characters in their parks. [123]  However, this only includes characters that Universal is currently using, other characters in their \"families\" (X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic Four, etc.), and the villains associated with said characters. [117]  This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet and greets, merchandise, attractions and more with other Marvel characters not associated with the characters at Islands of Adventures, such as  Star-Lord  and  Gamora  from  Guardians of the Galaxy .

I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC's 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as  Sol Harrison  and [production chief]  Jack Adler  were schmoozing with some of us \u2026 who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC  owned  Independent News). \u2026 As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. \u2026 Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. \u2026 Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth.\n \n Goodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA's strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor,  Stan Lee , to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in  Origins of Marvel Comics  ( Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books , 1974), p. 16:\n\"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called  The   [ sic ]  Justice League of America  and it was composed of a team of superheroes. \u2026 ' If the Justice League is selling ', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'\"\n \n \n \n References [ edit ] \n \n \n ^   \"Hachette - Our Clients\" .

Normally, your account will become confirmed automatically once you have made 10 edits and four days have passed since you created it.     \n You may already be able to upload files on the  Wikimedia Commons , but you can't do it on the English Wikipedia just yet. If the file you want to upload has a free license, please go to Commons and upload it there.\n Important note:  if you don't want to wait until you are autoconfirmed, you may ask somebody else to upload a file for you at  Wikipedia:Files for upload . \n In very rare cases an administrator may make your account confirmed manually through a request at  Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed . \n \n \n \n \n Step 1: Choose your file \n \n\n \n File: \n \n Choose a file from your computer. Maximum file size: 100 MB. Permitted file types: png, gif, jpg, jpeg, xcf, pdf, mid, ogg, ogv, svg, djvu, tiff, tif, oga. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Step 2: Describe your file \n \n\n \n Please provide a clear, descriptive name by which your file will be known on Wikipedia.\n \n \n \u00a0 \n \n This name must be unique across the whole of Wikipedia, so please make it informative and easy to recognize. It's no problem to use a fairly long name. It may also include spaces, commas and most other punctuation marks. Please also note that file names are case sensitive (with the exception of the first letter). Good:  \"City of London, skyline from London City Hall, Oct 2008.jpg\".  Bad : \"Skyline.jpg\", \"DSC0001234.jpg\". \n \n \n \n Sorry, a few special characters and character combinations cannot be used in the filename for technical reasons. This goes especially for  #\u00a0<\u00a0>\u00a0[\u00a0]\u00a0|\u00a0:\u00a0{\u00a0}\u00a0/\u00a0  and  ~~~ . Your filename has been modified to avoid these. Please check if it is okay now.\n \n \n \n The filename you chose seems to be very short, or overly generic. Please don't use:\n \n Titles that consist only of very generic descriptive words (e.g. \"Sunset.jpg\", \"Townhall.jpg\") \n Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. \"John.jpg\", \"Miller.jpg\") \n Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras (\"DSC_001234\", \"IMGP0345\"), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web (\"30996951316264l.jpg\") \n \n \n \n    Existing file . Last uploaded by  Example user . \n \n A file of this name already exists on Commons! \n If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used.\n This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases.\n Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead.\n \nIf you want to replace the existing file with an uncontroversial, improved version of the same work, please go to Commons and upload it there, not here on the English Wikipedia's local wiki. \n \n \n A file of this name already exists. \n If you upload your file with this name, you will be overwriting the existing file. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used. Please don't do this, unless you have a good reason to:\n \n \n\n \n \n \n No , I don't want to overwrite the existing file. I will choose a different name for my new file instead.\n \n \n \n \n Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file. My file is merely a new, improved and uncontentious version of the same work. The old description page, including the source and copyright information, will still be correct for the new version and can remain the same.\n \n \n \n \n Yes , I want to overwrite the existing file, and I will use this wizard to add a new description and new source information for it. The previous version was my own, or else I have made sure the previous uploader(s) don't object to this replacement.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Please provide a brief description of the contents of this file. This will be stored and displayed as part of the file description page. It is important that other editors be able to understand what this file is about. \n \n \n \u00a0 \n\n What does this file show? What is it a photo/diagram/recording of? It will be helpful if you also add a  wikilink  to the article where you want to use it. \n \n \n \n \n \n Step 3: Provide source and copyright information \n It is very important that you read through the following options and questions, and provide all required information truthfully and carefully. \n \n\n \n \n \n This is a free work.   I can demonstrate that it is legally okay for anybody to use, in Wikipedia and elsewhere, for any purpose.\n \n \n Thank you for offering to upload a free work. \n Wikipedia loves free files.

Uploading files on Commons works just the same as here. Your Wikipedia account will automatically work on Commons too. \n   Please consider  uploading your file on Commons . \n However, if you prefer to do it here instead, you may go ahead with this form. You can also first use this form to collect the information about your file and then send it to Commons from here.\n \n \n \n\n \n Copyright status: \n \n \n \n \n This file is  entirely my own work.

Note: files without verifiable permissions may be deleted. You may be better off obtaining proof of permission first. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n This file is  from a free published source. I took it from a website or other published source, where its author has explicitly placed it under a free license, allowing free re-use by anybody.\n \n \n Use this  only  if there is an  explicit licensing statement  in the source. \n The website must explicitly say that the image is released under a license that allows free re-use for any purpose, e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution license.

It is now legally in the  Public Domain .\n \n \n\n \n Original author: \n \n Please name the original author of this work. \n \n \n Lifetime: \n \n Specify date of death, if applicable to public domain status. In many cases, we need to be certain the author died before a certain year, in many cases before 1926. \n \n \n Original publication: \n \n Provide as much information as possible about the original time and place of publication of this work. For print publications: provide full bibliographic information. \n \n \n Date of publication: \n \n Provide date of first publication, and date of creation if different. \n \n \n Immediate source: \n \n State exactly where you found this file.

For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) \n \n \n Public Domain status: \n \n This work is free of all copyrights because:\n \n\n \n \n \n It was created and  first published before 1923  and is therefore in the Public Domain in the USA.\n \n \n \n \n It was  first published outside the USA , and it was in the Public Domain in its country of origin by the \" URAA date \". For most countries, this means the author died 70 years before 1 January 1996, i.e. before 1926. Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at  [1] . \n \n \n \n \n It was  first published in the USA before 1989 , and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice and/or without the necessary copyright registration. Please look up the exact rules at  [2] . \n \n \n \n \n Its copyright expired for some other reason. [Please explain below].\n \n \n \n \n Explanation:\n \n Please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This file is  in the Public Domain  for some other reason. I can demonstrate that this work is legally in the Public Domain, i.e. nobody owns any copyrights on it. This may be for a variety of reasons, for instance because it was created by the US Federal Government, or because it is too simple to attract any copyright.\n \n Public Domain  means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work. It does  not  mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others. \n This is  not  for images you simply found somewhere on the web. Most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody, even if you believe the owner won't care about that copyright. If it is in the public domain, you must be able to point to an actual law that makes it so. If you can't point to such a law but merely found this image somewhere, then  please do not upload it. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Author: \n \n Please name the original author of this work. \n \n \n Source: \n \n State exactly where you found this file.  For web sources: please provide a link to the html web page where the file can be found (\"http://... .html\"), not a direct link to the image file itself (\"http://... .jpg\"). For print sources: provide full bibliographic information (author, title, publisher, year, page, etc.) \n \n \n Date of creation:\n \n \n \n \n Public Domain status: \n \n This work is free of all copyrights because:\n \n\n \n \n \n It was created by an agency of the US Federal Government. This does  not  apply to  most US state and local agencies , nor to governments of other countries! \n \n \n \n \n It is an official governmental item, such as a flag, state emblem, banknote or postage stamp, from a country where such items are exempt from copyright according to local law. This does  not  apply to all countries, nor does it usually apply to  all  publications! (For instance, it usually doesn't apply to simple publicity photographs published on a governmental website.)  Please look up the copyright rules for the specific country in question. If the country does not have an exemption rule that applies to this item, go on with the section for \" non-free copyrighted works \" below. Explanation:   Add any explanation or evidence necessary to substantiate your statement above. Cite and provide a link to the relevant law if possible. \n \n \n \n \n It is too simple to be eligible for copyright. This typically applies only to graphics that consist solely of simple geometric shapes and/or a few letters or words, or to items such as mathematical or chemical formulae. It may apply to some very simple logos that do not contain complex pictorial elements. It  never  applies to photographs! \n \n \n \n \n It is in the Public Domain for some other reason. Explanation:   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This is a copyrighted, non-free work, but I believe it is Fair Use.

Such files normally cannot be used even under the \"Fair Use\" rules, except in rare cases. \n any file that is licensed for use exclusively on Wikipedia, or is free except that the free license excludes commercial use. \n If you are in any doubt, please ask some experienced editors for advice before uploading.

Lists and  indices  are examples of contents for a published work, and Wikipedia has  many of each , including a  complete alphabetical index  and  indices by category .   Links to all of Wikipedia's main contents pages are presented below, and they in turn link to the more specific pages. \n Curated article collections \n Overview articles \n Overview articles summarize in prose a broad topic like  biology , and also have illustrations and links to subtopics like  cell biology , biographies like  Carl Linnaeus , and other related articles like  Human Genome Project .\n \n Portal:Contents/Overviews  lists overview articles from covered fields in a single page. \n Outline pages \n Outline pages have  trees  of topics in an  outline format , which in turn are linked to further outlines and articles providing more detail.  Outlines show how important subtopics relate to each other based on how they are arranged in the tree, and they are useful as a more condensed, non-prose alternative to overview articles.\n \n Portal:Contents/Outlines  is a comprehensive list of \"Outline of __\" pages, organized by subject. It is itself an outline, that links (almost) exclusively to other outlines. \n Outline of academic disciplines  covers subjects studied in college or university, and provides links to prose overview articles and their corresponding outlines. \n Outline of knowledge  is the top-level outline, its subject being the broadest one of all. It is the ancestor of all other outlines, and they branch out from it, in successive levels. \n Third-party classification systems \n Various third-party classification systems have been mapped to Wikipedia articles, which can be accessed from these pages:\n \n Library of Congress Classification \n List of Dewey Decimal classes \n Figurative system of human knowledge \n Outline of Roget's Thesaurus \n Prop\u00e6dia \n Tree of knowledge system \n Universal Decimal Classification \n Vital articles \n Main page:  Wikipedia:Vital articles \n Vital articles are lists of subjects for which Wikipedia should have corresponding high-quality articles. They serve as  centralized watchlists  to track the status of Wikipedia's most important articles.\n \n Vital articles level 1  \u2013 10 most important articles \n Vital articles level 2  \u2013 100 most important articles \n Vital articles level 3  \u2013 1,000 most important articles \n Vital articles level 4  \u2013 10,000 most important articles \n Vital articles level 5  \u2013 50,000 most important articles \n Reference collections \n Wikipedia has several types of pages which provide content in a non-prose form, for reference purposes.\n \n List pages \n List pages enumerate items of a particular type, such as the  List of sovereign states  or  List of South Africans .  Wikipedia has \"lists of lists\" when there are too many items to fit on a single page, when the items can be sorted in different ways, or as a way of navigating lists on a topic (for example  Lists of countries and territories  or Lists of people).  There are several ways to find lists:\n \n Portal:Contents/Lists  \u2013 A limited single-page collection of lists and lists of lists \n List of lists of lists  \u2013 A broad single-page collection of lists of lists \n Category:Lists  \u2013 Browse lists comprehensively via the multi-page Wikipedia category system \n Timelines \n Timelines  list events chronologically, sometimes including links to articles with more detail.  There are several ways to find timelines:\n \n List of timelines  has a long single-page collection \n Category:Timelines  has a comprehensive multi-page collection via the Wikipedia category system \n Of particular interest may be:\n \n List of centuries \n List of decades \n List of historical anniversaries \u00a0\u2013 e.g. events on January 1 of any year \n 2019 \u00a0\u2013 major events this year \n Portal:Current events \u00a0\u2013 featured current events and related project activities \n Deaths in 2019 \u00a0\u2013 lists notable people who died this year \n Category:Graphical timelines \u00a0\u2013 graphical timelines in the category and subcategories, arranged alphabetically \n Glossaries \n Glossaries  are lists of terms with definitions. Wikipedia includes hundreds of alphabetical glossaries; they can be found two ways:\n \n Portal:Contents/Glossaries  \u2013 A single-page list of glossaries \n Category:Wikipedia glossaries  \u2013 Browse glossaries comprehensively via the Wikipedia category system \n Bibliographies \n Bibliographies  list sources on a given topic, for verification or further reading outside Wikipedia:\n \n Wikipedia:List of bibliographies  is a list of bibliographies \n Category:Wikipedia bibliographies  has a complete multi-page listing of bibliographies on Wikipedia \n Category:Discographies \n Discographies  catalog the sound recordings of individual artists or groups.\n \n Category:Discographies  has a complete multi-page listing \n Special format collections \n Portals \n Portals  include featured articles, images, news, categories, excerpts of key articles, links to related portals, and to-do lists for editors.  There are two ways to find portals:\n \n Portal:Contents/Portals  \u2013 A single-page list of portals \n Category:Portals  \u2013 Browse portals comprehensively via the Wikipedia category system \n Wikipedia books \n Wikipedia books  are collections of Wikipedia articles that can be viewed, downloaded, or printed into a book. They provide a roadmap for a course of study in a particular subject.\n \n Category:Wikipedia books (community books) \u00a0\u2013 an alphabetical list of the books \n Category:Wikipedia books \u00a0\u2013 a list of the books, categorized by topic \n Spoken articles \n Growing collections of Wikipedia articles are starting to become available as spoken word recordings as well.\n \n Category:Spoken articles \u00a0\u2013 an organized list of all spoken articles \n Wikipedia:Spoken articles \u00a0\u2013 some general information about the spoken article technology \n Collections of articles \n Category system \n Wikipedia's  collection of category pages  is a classified index system.  It is automatically generated from category tags at the bottoms of articles and most other pages.

ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE.

Definitions \n \n \" Adaptation \" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. \n \" Collection \" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. \n \" Creative Commons Compatible License \" means a license that is listed at  https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses  that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License. \n \" Distribute \" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership. \n \" License Elements \" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike. \n \" Licensor \" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License. \n \" Original Author \" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast. \n \" Work \" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work. \n \" You \" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation. \n \" Publicly Perform \" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images. \n \" Reproduce \" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium. \n \n 2. Fair Dealing Rights \n Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n \n 3. License Grant \n Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n \n \n to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; \n to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\"; \n to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and, \n to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations. \n For the avoidance of doubt:\n\t \n\t\t Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; \n\t\t Waivable Compulsory License Schemes.  In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and, \n\t\t Voluntary License Schemes.  The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License. \n\t \n \n \n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n \n 4. Restrictions \n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n \n \n You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. \n You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License. \n If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties. \n Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise. \n \n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer \n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n \n 6. Limitation on Liability \n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n \n 7. Termination \n \n This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License. \n Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above. \n \n 8. Miscellaneous \n \n Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. \n Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License. \n If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. \n No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. \n This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You. \n The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law. \n \n Creative Commons Notice \n Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of the License.\n \nCreative Commons may be contacted at  https://creativecommons.org/ . \n \n \n\n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t Retrieved from \" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License&oldid=880226358 \" \n\t\t\n\t\t Categories :  Wikipedia copyright Hidden categories:  Wikipedia fully-protected project pages Project pages with short description \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t \n \n \n\t \n \n\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Navigation menu \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Personal tools \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Namespaces \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Project page Talk \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Variants \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Views \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Read View source View history \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t More \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Search \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Navigation \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Interaction \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Tools \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Wikidata item \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t In other projects \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Wikimedia Commons Wikispecies Wikibooks Wikidata Wikivoyage Wiktionary \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Print/export \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Create a book Download as PDF Printable version \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Languages \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Alemannisch \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 Bosanski \u010ce\u0161tina Cymraeg Deutsch Espa\u00f1ol \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc Fran\u00e7ais Galego \u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 Bahasa Indonesia Italiano \u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea Magyar \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 Malagasy \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e Napulitano \u0b13\u0b21\u0b3c\u0b3f\u0b06 Portugu\u00eas \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 Shqip Simple English \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 / srpski Srpskohrvatski / \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438 Suomi V\u00e8neto Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t \u5434\u8bed \u7cb5\u8a9e \u4e2d\u6587 \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Edit links \t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This page was last edited on 26 January 2019, at 04:27 \u00a0(UTC) . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Text is available under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ;\nadditional terms may apply.

Mainly, when a page refers to Marvel referring to the Marvel Company, but then stating the character  involved, which would be the best site to use? For example, the mavel in \"Rom the Spaceknight, a Galadorian spaceknight from the Marvel universe\" would most likely link to the Marvel Family site, but it could also be the Marvel Company site. A more ambigious example would be \"...Peter Benjamin Parker and a Marvel Comics superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, ...\". For this, i would imagine linking to the Marvel Comics page is best, but it is also directly referencing the Marvel Family. Its all very confusing... - Trjn  14:21, 16 September 2005 (UTC)\n MARVEL WAS CREATED BY STAN LEE THE CREATER OF SPIDER-MAN, CAPTAIN AMERICA ,AND ALL THE REST OF THE MARVEL CHARECTER.\n \n Marvel Forums- \nwww.talkmarvel.com    \u2014Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  76.29.64.179  ( talk ) 03:19, 13 September 2007 (UTC)   \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\t\t\n\t\t Retrieved from \" https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Marvel&oldid=879035664 \" \n\t\t\n\t\t Categories :  WikiProject Disambiguation pages \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t \n \n \n\t \n \n\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Navigation menu \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Personal tools \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Namespaces \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Article Talk \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Variants \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Views \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Read Edit New section View history \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t More \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Search \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Navigation \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Interaction \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Tools \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Print/export \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Create a book Download as PDF Printable version \t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Languages \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This page was last edited on 18 January 2019, at 15:44 \u00a0(UTC) . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Text is available under the  Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ;\nadditional terms may apply.

The name \"Wikipedia\" is a  portmanteau  of the words  wiki  (a technology for creating collaborative  websites , from the  Hawaiian  word  wiki , meaning \"quick\") and  encyclopedia . Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.\n Wikipedia is  written collaboratively  by largely anonymous  volunteers  who write without pay. Anyone with  Internet  access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in  limited cases  where  editing  is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. Users can  contribute anonymously , under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity. \nThe fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the  five pillars . The  Wikipedia community  has developed many  policies and guidelines  to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.\n Since its creation on January 15, 2001,  Wikipedia  has grown rapidly into one of the  largest  reference  websites , attracting 374 million unique visitors monthly as of September\u00a02015 [update] . [1]  There are about  72,000 active contributors  working on more than  48,000,000 articles  in  302 languages . As of today, there are 5,959,545 articles in  English . Every day, hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to augment the knowledge held by the  Wikipedia  encyclopedia. (See the  statistics page  for more information.)\n People  of all ages, cultures and backgrounds can add or  edit  article prose, references, images and other media here. What is contributed is more important than the expertise or qualifications of the contributor. What will remain depends upon whether the content is free of  copyright restrictions  and contentious material  about living people , and whether it fits within Wikipedia's  policies , including being  verifiable  against a published  reliable source , thereby excluding editors'  opinions  and beliefs and  unreviewed research . Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes and many experienced editors are watching to help ensure that edits are cumulative improvements. Begin by simply clicking the  Edit   link  at the top of any editable page!\n Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. In addition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well. Wikipedia is a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of completion. As articles develop, they tend to become more comprehensive and balanced. Quality also improves over time as misinformation and other errors are removed or repaired. However, because anyone can click \"edit\" at any time and add content, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors, or  vandalism . Awareness of this helps the reader to obtain valid information, avoid recently added misinformation (see  Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia ), and fix the article.\n See also:  Wikipedia:FAQ  and  Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia \n \n Contents \n \n 1   About Wikipedia \n \n 1.1   Wikipedia history \n 1.2   Wikipedia contributors \n 1.3   Trademarks and copyrights \n 1.4   Credits \n \n \n 2   Making the best use of Wikipedia \n \n 2.1   Exploring Wikipedia \n 2.2   Basic navigation in Wikipedia \n 2.3   Using Wikipedia as a research tool \n 2.4   Wikipedia vs paper encyclopedias \n 2.5   Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality in Wikipedia \n 2.6   Disclaimers \n \n \n 3   Contributing to Wikipedia \n \n 3.1   Editing Wikipedia pages \n 3.2   Wikipedia content criteria \n 3.3   Editorial administration, oversight, and management \n 3.4   Handling disputes and abuse \n 3.5   Editorial quality review \n \n \n 4   Technical attributes \n 5   Feedback and questions \n \n 5.1   Frequently asked questions (FAQ) \n 5.2   Static help \n 5.3   Giving feedback \n 5.4   Research help and similar questions \n 5.5   Community discussion \n 5.6   Contacting individual Wikipedia editors \n \n \n 6   Other languages \n 7   Sister projects \n 8   See also \n 9   References \n 10   Further reading \n 11   External links \n \n \n\n About Wikipedia \n For information on the administrative structure of Wikipedia, see  Wikipedia:Administration . \n See also:  Wikipedia:Purpose \n Further information:  Wikipedia:Essay directory \u00a7\u00a0About Wikipedia \n Wikipedia history \n Further information:  History of Wikipedia \n    The  English edition of Wikipedia  has grown to 5,959,545 articles, equivalent to  over 2,000 print volumes  of the  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica . Including all language editions, Wikipedia has over 38\u00a0million articles, equivalent to  over 15,000 print volumes . \n Wikipedia  was founded as an offshoot of  Nupedia , a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia, begun by the online media company  Bomis . Nupedia had an elaborate system of  peer review  and required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was slow. During 2000,  Jimmy Wales  (founder of Nupedia and co-founder of Bomis), and  Larry Sanger , whom Wales had employed to work on the encyclopedia project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project. Multiple sources suggested that a  wiki  might allow members of the public to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January\u00a010, 2001.\n There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the wiki format, so the new project was given the name \"Wikipedia\" and launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January\u00a015 (now called  \"Wikipedia Day\"  by some users). The  bandwidth  and  server  (in San Diego) were donated by Wales. Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include  Tim Shell , one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.\n In May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched\u2014in  Catalan ,  Chinese ,  Dutch ,  Esperanto ,  French ,  German ,  Hebrew ,  Italian ,  Japanese ,  Portuguese ,  Russian ,  Spanish , and  Swedish . These were soon joined by  Arabic  and  Hungarian . In September, [2]   Polish  was added, and further commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made. At the end of the year,  Afrikaans ,  Norwegian , and  Serbo-Croatian  versions were announced.\n The domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the not-for-profit  Wikimedia Foundation  was launched, in 2003, as its new parent organization, with the \".org\"  top-level domain  denoting its non-commercial nature. Today, there are Wikipedias in over 250 languages.\n \n Wikipedia contributors \n Main pages:  Wikipedia:Who writes Wikipedia?  and  Wikipedia:Wikipedians \n Further information:  Wikipedia:Administration \u00a7\u00a0Editors \n Play media    Wikipedia contributors \n Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages inclusion of a tremendous amount of content. About 70,000\u00a0editors\u2014from expert scholars to casual readers\u2014regularly edit Wikipedia, and these experienced editors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia, following our  Manual of Style .\n Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource while maintaining  civility . Editors are able to watch pages and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits. Where there are disagreements on how to display facts, editors often work together to compile an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject. Aspiring authors may wish to read the information on  Contributing to Wikipedia  before contributing to the project.\n Although the Wikimedia Foundation owns the site, it is largely uninvolved in writing and daily operations.\n \n Trademarks and copyrights \n Main pages:  Wikipedia:Copyrights  and  wmf:Trademark policy \n \" Wikipedia \" is a registered  trademark  of the  not-for-profit   Wikimedia Foundation , which has created a family of free-content  projects  that are built by user contributions.\n Most of Wikipedia's text and many of its images are dual-licensed under the  Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike\u00a03.0 Unported License  (CC-BY-SA) and the  GNU Free Documentation License  (GFDL) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).

At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and  new articles  are also being created. Changes can be viewed at the  Recent changes  page and a random page at  random articles . Over 5,600\u00a0articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as  featured articles , exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia. Another 30,000\u00a0articles are designated as  good articles . Some information on Wikipedia is organized into  lists ; the best of these are designated as  featured lists . Wikipedia also has  portals , which organize content around topic areas. Articles can be found using the  search  box on the top-right side of the screen.\n Wikipedia is available in languages other than English. Wikipedia has  more than two hundred and eighty languages , including a  Simple English  version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service (see  sister projects ). All these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.\n \n Basic navigation in Wikipedia \n Main page:  Help:Navigation \n Wikipedia articles are all  linked , or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like  this  is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, and  organized categories of knowledge  which can be searched and traversed in a loose  hierarchy  for more information. Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our  sister projects . Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing\u2014this is one simple way to contribute.\n \n Using Wikipedia as a research tool \n Main pages:  Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia  and  Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia \n As  wiki  documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved. Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.\n Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information. Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a  neutral point of view  reached through  consensus . Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time\u2014months or years perhaps\u2014to achieve a better balanced coverage of their subject. In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive. However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage. In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach. Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.\n The  ideal  Wikipedia article is well written, balanced,  neutral , and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable,  verifiable  knowledge. An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have. Our best articles are called  Featured Articles  (and display a small star in the upper right corner of the article), and our second best tier of articles are designated  Good Articles . However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors. Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully  cited . Others will later be augmented with new sections. Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.\n While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity.  Guidelines and information pages  are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the  reliability of Wikipedia .\n \n Wikipedia vs paper encyclopedias \n Main page:  Wikipedia is not paper  (on  Wikimedia Meta-Wiki ). \n Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias. First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add to it.\n Second, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles. Therefore, it has a very large pool of contributors: the whole world. This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.\n Third, a paper encyclopedia remains static (stays the same) and falls out of date until the next edition. But Wikipedia is dynamic: you don't have to wait for the next edition to come out (there are no editions), as Wikipedia is published on-line as it is written on-line. Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in.  You  can update Wikipedia at any instant, and people do so continually around the clock, thereby helping each other to keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and of the latest facts in every subject.\n Fourth, Wikipedia has a very low \"publishing\" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is on-line, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution. This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone. This has enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages at the same time, by people literate in each language. Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.\n Fifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact  in some respects , since it never needs to be printed, although computers have their own  environmental cost .\n Sixth, Wikipedia is extra-linear (more than linear). Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates  hypertext  in the form of  wikilinks . Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility. The encyclopedia also has correlates to  tables of contents  and  indexes , with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.\n Seventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.\n Eighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten. It is a community effort, with most people who are involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way. See more about Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses, below \u00a0 ...\n \n Strengths, weaknesses, and article quality in Wikipedia \n Main pages:  Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is so great  and  Wikipedia:Why Wikipedia is not so great \n See also:  Reliability of Wikipedia  and  Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia \n Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.\n \n Wikipedia is  open to a large contributor base , drawing a large number of editors from diverse backgrounds. This allows Wikipedia to significantly reduce regional and cultural bias found in many other publications, and makes it very difficult for any person or group to  censor and impose bias . A large, diverse editor base also provides access and breadth on subject matter that is otherwise inaccessible or little documented. A large number of editors contributing at any moment also means Wikipedia can produce encyclopedic articles and resources covering newsworthy events within hours or days of their occurrence. It also means that like any publication, Wikipedia may reflect the cultural, age, socio-economic, and other biases of its contributors. There is no systematic process to make sure that  \"obviously important\" topics  are written about, so Wikipedia may contain unexpected oversights and omissions. While  most  articles may be altered by anyone, in practice editing will be performed by a certain  demographic  (younger rather than older, male rather than female, rich enough to afford a computer rather than poor, et cetera) and may, therefore, show some bias. Some topics may not be covered well, while others may be covered in great depth. \n Allowing  anyone to edit  Wikipedia makes it easily vandalized  and  susceptible to unchecked information, which requires removal. See  Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism . While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is more subject to subtle viewpoint promotion than a typical reference work. However, bias that would be unchallenged in a traditional reference work is likely to be ultimately challenged or considered on Wikipedia. While Wikipedia articles generally attain a good standard after editing, it is important to note that fledgling articles and those monitored less well may be susceptible to vandalism and insertion of false information. Wikipedia's radical openness also means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state, such as in the middle of a large edit, or a controversial rewrite. Many contributors do not yet comply fully with key  policies , or may add information without  citable  sources. Wikipedia's open approach tremendously increases the chances that any particular factual error or misleading statement will be relatively promptly corrected. Numerous editors at any given time are monitoring  recent changes  and edits to articles on their  watchlists . \n Wikipedia is  written by open and transparent consensus \u2014an approach that has its pros and cons. Censorship or imposing \"official\" points of view is extremely difficult to achieve and usually fails after a time. Eventually for most articles, all notable views become fairly described and a  neutral point of view  reached. In reality, the process of reaching consensus may be long and drawn-out, with articles fluid or changeable for a long time while they find their \"neutral approach\" that all sides can agree on. Reaching neutrality is occasionally made harder by  extreme-viewpoint contributors . Wikipedia operates a full editorial dispute resolution process, one that allows time for discussion and resolution in depth, but one that also permits disagreements to last for months before poor-quality or biased edits are removed. A common conclusion is that Wikipedia is a valuable resource and provides a good reference point on its subjects. \n That said, articles and subject areas sometimes suffer from significant omissions, and while misinformation and vandalism are usually corrected quickly, this does not always happen. (See for example  this incident  in which a person inserted a fake biography linking a prominent journalist to the Kennedy assassinations and Soviet Russia as a joke on a co-worker which went undetected for four months, saying afterwards he \"didn\u2019t know  Wikipedia  was used as a serious reference tool\".) \n Wikipedia is  written largely by amateurs . Those with expert credentials are given no additional weight. Wikipedia is also not subject to any peer review for scientific, medical or engineering articles. One advantage to having amateurs write in Wikipedia is that they have more free time on their hands so that they can make rapid changes in response to current events. The wider the general public interest in a topic, the more likely it is to attract contributions from non-specialists. \n The  MediaWiki  software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never \"vanishes\" irreversibly. Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics. Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article. As with any source, information should be checked. A 2005 editorial by a  BBC   technology  writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information (including search engines and the media), and may lead to \"a better sense of how to evaluate information sources\". [3] \n \n Disclaimers \n Disclaimers \n General \n Content \n Legal \n Medical \n Risk \n \nRelated \n Academic use \n Non-Wikipedia \n v t e \n Main page:  Wikipedia:General disclaimer \n Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia. However, the consensus in Wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each article. Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected. Some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in Wikipedia.\n Wikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has led to commentators citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is unreliable. A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable (including sources such as  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica ,  Associated Press , and the  Oxford English Dictionary ) can be read and compared at  Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers .\n \n Contributing to Wikipedia \n   Contributing to Wikipedia \n Protocols \n \n Editing policy \n ( Content policies ) \n Etiquette guide \n ( Dispute resolution ) \n Simple rule set \n Simple style manual \n \n \n Introductions \n \n About Wikipedia \n ( Administration ) \n How to contribute \n ( Tutorial ) \n Newcomers' primer \n Plain & simple \n Wikipedia Adventure \n VisualEditor \n \n \n How-to pages \n \n Creating an account \n How to edit \n Starting an article \n ( Article wizard ) \n Talk pages \n ( BOLD, revert, discuss ) \n Referencing \n Renaming \n Deletion \n Media \n Lists \n Tables \n Templates \n Copying text \n Style tips \n Wiki markup \n \n \n Writing advice \n \n Article development \n Basic copyediting \n Layouts \n Avoiding mistakes \n Writing better \n Perfect article \n Advanced editing \n Writing about women \n \n \n Community \n \n Portal \n Dashboard \n Essays \n Maintenance \n WikiProjects \n Editor's index \n \n \n Directories \n \n FAQs \n Help index \n Tools \n \n \n Interactive help \n \n Teahouse \n Help desk \n \n v t e \n Main page:  Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia \n See also:  Wikipedia:Your first article  and  Guide to fixing vandalism \n    A downloadable  \"Editing Wikipedia guide\"  in PDF form written by the staff at the Wikimedia Foundation \n Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the  Edit  tab in an article. Before beginning to contribute, however, read some handy helping tools such as the  tutorial  and the  policies and guidelines , as well as  our welcome page .  Creating an account  offers  many benefits . It is important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are expected to be  civil  and  neutral , respecting all points of view, and add only  verifiable  and factual information rather than  personal views and opinions . \" The five pillars of Wikipedia \" cover this approach and are recommended reading before editing. (Vandals are reported via the  Administrator Notice Board  and may be temporarily  blocked  from editing Wikipedia.)\n Most articles start as  stubs , but after many contributions, they can become  featured articles . Once the contributor has decided a topic of interest, they may want to  request that the article  be written (or they could research the issue and write it themselves). Wikipedia has on-going  projects , focused on specific topic areas or tasks, which help coordinate editing.\n The ease of editing Wikipedia results in many people editing. That makes the updating of the encyclopedia very quick, almost as fast as news websites.\n \n Editing Wikipedia pages \n Main pages:  Help:Editing  and  Help:Wikitext \n Play media    Editing tutorial for Wikipedia using classic wiki markup.  (3:07 min) \n Wikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page  layout  to allow editors to concentrate on adding material rather than page design. Page aspects facilitated include:\n \n sections and subsections \u2014which follow a page's  lead section/introduction  and (if specific conditions are met) a  table of contents , \n references , \n images , \n tables , \n indentations \n lists , \n links , \n ISBNs , \n maths , \n formatting elements and most world alphabets and common symbols, most of which have simple formats that are deliberately very easy and intuitive. \n Normally editing is chosen by clicking the  Edit  tab at the top of a Wikipedia page (or on a  section-edit link ). This will take you to a new page with a  text box  containing the editable text of the page you were viewing. In this box, you can type in the text that you want to add, using wiki markup to format the text and add other elements like images and tables. You should then press the  Show preview  button to review your contributions for any errors. When you have finished editing, you should write a short  edit summary  in the small field below the edit-box describing your changes before you press the  Publish changes  button. This will help others to understand the intention of your edit. To avoid accidentally leaving edit summaries blank, you can select \"Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary\" on the  Edit  tab of your  personal preferences .\n Page editing is accessed through tabs that are found along the top edge of the page. These are:\n \n Article.  Shows the main Wikipedia article. \n Talk.  Shows a user discussion about the article's topic and possible revisions, controversies, etc. \n Edit.  This tab allows users to edit the article. Depending on the page\u2019s susceptibility to vandalism, according to its visibility or the degree of controversy surrounding the topic, this tab may not be shown for all users. (For example, any user who is not an  administrator  will not be able to edit the  Main Page .) \n View history.  This tab allows readers to view the editors of the article and the changes that have been made. \n Star.  (\"Watch\") If you are logged into your account, clicking on the star icon will cause any changes made to the article to be displayed on the watchlist. (Note: when this icon is clicked, it changes to a filled-in star.) \n Wikipedia has robust  version and reversion controls . This means that poor-quality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editor, so inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake in their editing. As there are many more editors intent on improving articles than not, error-ridden articles are usually corrected promptly.\n \n Wikipedia content criteria \n Main pages:  Wikipedia:Wikipedia in brief  and  Wikipedia:Core content policies \n \n Core content policies \n Neutral point of view \n No original research \n Verifiability \n \n Other  content policies \n Article titles \n Biographies of living persons \n Image use policy \n What Wikipedia is not \n v t e \n Wikipedia content is intended to be factual, notable, verifiable with cited external sources, and neutrally presented.\n The appropriate policies and guidelines for these are found at:\n \n Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not , which summarizes what belongs in Wikipedia and what does not; \n Wikipedia:Neutral point of view , which describes Wikipedia's mandatory core approach to neutral, unbiased article-writing; \n Wikipedia:No original research , which prohibits the use of Wikipedia to publish personal views and original research of editors and defines Wikipedia's role as an encyclopedia of existing  recognized  knowledge; \n Wikipedia:Verifiability , which explains that it must be possible for readers to verify all content against credible external sources (following the guidance in the  Wikipedia:Risk disclaimer  that is linked-to at the end of every article); \n Wikipedia:Reliable sources , which explains what factors determine whether a source is acceptable; \n Wikipedia:Citing sources , which describes the manner of citing sources so that readers can verify content for themselves; \n And  Wikipedia:Manual of Style , which offers a style guide\u2014in general editors tend to acquire knowledge of appropriate writing styles and detailed formatting over time. \n These are often abbreviated to  WP:NOT ,  WP:NPOV ,  WP:NOR ,  WP:V ,  WP:RS ,  WP:CITE , and  WP:MOS  respectively.\n \n Editorial administration, oversight, and management \n Main pages:  Wikipedia:Administration  and  Wikipedia:Editorial oversight and control \n Play media    Video guided tour #2: Why does Wikipedia work even though anyone can edit it? \n The Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role s/he may choose, subject to peer approval. Individuals often will choose to become involved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing articles at others' request, watching current edits for vandalism, watching newly created articles for quality control purposes, or similar roles. Editors who believe they can serve the community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may ask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities. This structure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct. At present a minimum approval of 75\u201380% from the community is required to take on these additional tools and responsibilities. This standard tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust, and familiarity across a broad front of aspects within Wikipedia.\n A variety of  software-assisted systems  and  automated programs  help editors and administrators to watch for problematic edits and editors. Theoretically all editors and users are treated equally with no \"power structure\". There is, however,  a hierarchy of permissions and positions , some of which are listed hereafter:\n \n Anyone  can edit most of the articles here.  Some articles are protected  because of vandalism or edit-warring, and can be edited only by certain editors. \n Anyone with an account that has been registered for four days or longer and has made at least ten edits becomes  autoconfirmed , and gains the technical ability to do five things that non-autoconfirmed editors cannot:\n Create pages. \n Move pages. \n Edit semi-protected pages. \n Upload files. \n Vote in certain elections (minimum edit count to receive suffrage varies depending on the election). \n Many editors with accounts obtain access to certain tools that make editing easier and faster. Few editors learn about most of those tools, but one common privilege granted to editors in good standing is \" rollback \", which is the ability to undo edits more easily. \n Administrators  (\"admins\" or \"sysops\") have been approved by the community, and have access to some significant administrative tools. They can  delete articles , block accounts or IP addresses, and edit fully protected articles. \n Bureaucrats  are chosen in a process similar to that for selecting administrators. There are not very many bureaucrats. They have the technical ability to add or remove admin rights and approve or revoke \" bot \" privileges. \n The  Arbitration Committee  is analogous to Wikipedia's  supreme court . They deal with disputes that remain unresolved after other attempts at dispute resolution have failed. Members of this Committee are elected by the community and tend to be selected from among the pool of experienced admins. \n Stewards  hold the top echelon of community permissions. Stewards can do a few technical things, and one almost never hears much about them since they normally act only when a local admin or bureaucrat is not available, and hence almost never on the English Wikipedia. There are very few stewards. \n Jimmy Wales , the founder of Wikipedia, has several special roles and privileges. In most instances, however, he does not expect to be treated differently than any other editor or administrator. \n Handling disputes and abuse \n Main pages:  Wikipedia:Vandalism ,  Wikipedia:Dispute resolution ,  Wikipedia:Consensus ,  Wikipedia:Sock puppetry , and  Wikipedia:Conflict of interest \n Wikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise. These methods are well-tested and should be relied upon.\n \n Intentional  vandalism  can be  reported  and corrected by anyone. \n Unresolved  disputes  between editors, whether based upon behavior, editorial approach, or validity of content, can be addressed through the  talk page  of an article, through  requesting comments from other editors  or through Wikipedia's comprehensive  dispute resolution  process. \n Abuse of user accounts , such as the creation of \" Internet sock puppets \" or solicitation of friends and other parties to enforce a non-neutral viewpoint or  inappropriate consensus  within a discussion, or to disrupt other Wikipedia processes in an annoying manner, are addressed through the  sock puppet policy . \n In addition, new users may initially find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal  polls  in order to prevent abuse of  single-purpose accounts .\n \n Editorial quality review \n As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full  style and content manual  and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement. Examples of the processes include  peer review ,  good article assessment , and  the featured article process , a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.\n In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive  projects , assessment processes (such as  biographical article assessment ), and expert reviewers within specific subjects. Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus on the  neutral point of view noticeboard  or in  WikiProject Cleanup .\n \n Technical attributes \n Wikipedia uses  MediaWiki  software, the  open-source  program used not only on  Wikimedia projects  but also on many other third-party websites. The hardware supporting the Wikimedia projects is based on several hundred servers in various hosting centers around the world.  Full descriptions of these servers and their roles are available on this Meta-Wiki page . For technical information about Wikipedia, check  Technical FAQ . Wikipedia publishes various types of  metadata ; and, across its pages, are many thousands of  microformats .\n \n Feedback and questions \n Wikipedia is run as a communal effort. It is a community project whose result is an encyclopedia. Feedback about content should, in the first instance, be raised on the discussion pages of those articles.  Be bold  and edit the pages to add information or correct mistakes.\n \n Frequently asked questions (FAQ) \n Main page:  Wikipedia:FAQ \n FAQ index \n Category:Wikipedia FAQs \n Static help \n The  Help:Contents  may be accessed by clicking  help  displayed under the  \u25ba \u00a0Interaction \u00a0tab at the top left of all pages.\n \n Help:Menu \u2014is a menu-style page that will direct you to the right place to find information. \n Help:Directory \u2014is a descriptive listing of all Wikipedia's informative, instructional and consultation pages. \n Giving feedback \n There is an established escalation-and-dispute process within Wikipedia, as well as pages designed for questions, feedback, suggestions, and comments.

If, however, information is found to be missing from Wikipedia,  be bold  and  add it  so others can gain.\n \n Community discussion \n For a listing of ongoing discussions and current requests, see the  dashboard . For specific discussion not related to article content or editor conduct, see the  Village pump , which covers such subjects as  milestone announcements ,  policy  and  technical  discussion, and information on other specialized portals such as the  help ,  reference  and  peer review  desks. The  Community portal  is a centralized place to find things to do, collaborations, and general editing help information, and find out what is happening.  The Signpost , a community-edited newspaper, has recent news regarding Wikipedia, its sister projects, and the  Wikimedia Foundation .\n \n Contacting individual Wikipedia editors \n To contact individual contributors, leave a message on their  talk page . Standard places to ask policy and project-related questions are the  Village pump , online, and the  Wikipedia mailing lists , over e-mail. Reach other  Wikipedians  via  IRC  and  e-mail .\n In addition, the Wikimedia Foundation  Meta-Wiki  is a site for coordinating the various Wikipedia projects and sister projects (and abstract discussions of policy and direction). Also available are places for submitting  bug reports and feature requests .\n For a full list of contact options, see  Wikipedia:Questions .\n \n Other languages \n \n This Wikipedia is written in  English .

One of its tools, the  database scanner , lets you do exhaustive searches of the encyclopedia's content.  It can search article titles and article contents.  The tool supports  regex , so you have unlimited possibilities for search criteria.\n The tool works off-line, directly on a copy of the  Wikipedia database that you have downloaded .\n It will find absolutely every occurrence of an entered search string, and return the names of all the articles that it comes across that contain it.  Unfortunately, it only presents a maximum of 30,000 page names, at which point it will stop. So, the more specific the search criteria, the better.\n For on-the-fly general discussion and support requests for AWB, try the AWB IRC channel:  #AutoWikiBrowser   connect \n \n @media all and

(For technical reasons it does not list pages in the template namespace, but there should be no disambiguation pages there anyway.)\n \n \n See also [ edit ] \n Category:All article disambiguation pages  \u2013 only lists disambiguation pages in the main namespace \n Category:All set index articles  \u2013 the corresponding category for set index articles \n Category:WikiProject Disambiguation pages \n \n \n Contents:   Top   0\u20139   A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P   Q   R   S   T   U   V   W   X   Y   Z #    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 A    Aa    Ab    Ac    Ad    Ae    Af    Ag    Ah    Ai    Aj    Ak    Al    Am    An    Ao    Ap    Aq    Ar    As    At    Au    Av    Aw    Ax    Ay    Az   B    Ba    Bb    Bc    Bd    Be    Bf    Bg    Bh    Bi    Bj    Bk    Bl    Bm    Bn    Bo    Bp    Bq    Br    Bs    Bt    Bu    Bv    Bw    Bx    By    Bz   C    Ca    Cb    Cc    Cd    Ce    Cf    Cg    Ch    Ci    Cj    Ck    Cl    Cm    Cn    Co    Cp    Cq    Cr    Cs    Ct    Cu    Cv    Cw    Cx    Cy    Cz   D    Da    Db    Dc    Dd    De    Df    Dg    Dh    Di    Dj    Dk    Dl    Dm    Dn    Do    Dp    Dq    Dr    Ds    Dt    Du    Dv    Dw    Dx    Dy    Dz   E    Ea    Eb    Ec    Ed    Ee    Ef    Eg    Eh    Ei    Ej    Ek    El    Em    En    Eo    Ep    Eq    Er    Es    Et    Eu    Ev    Ew    Ex    Ey    Ez   F    Fa    Fb    Fc    Fd    Fe    Ff    Fg    Fh    Fi    Fj    Fk    Fl    Fm    Fn    Fo    Fp    Fq    Fr    Fs    Ft    Fu    Fv    Fw    Fx    Fy    Fz   G    Ga    Gb    Gc    Gd    Ge    Gf    Gg    Gh    Gi    Gj    Gk    Gl    Gm    Gn    Go    Gp    Gq    Gr    Gs    Gt    Gu    Gv    Gw    Gx    Gy    Gz   H    Ha    Hb    Hc    Hd    He    Hf    Hg    Hh    Hi    Hj    Hk    Hl    Hm    Hn    Ho    Hp    Hq    Hr    Hs    Ht    Hu    Hv    Hw    Hx    Hy    Hz   I    Ia    Ib    Ic    Id    Ie    If    Ig    Ih    Ii    Ij    Ik    Il    Im    In    Io    Ip    Iq    Ir    Is    It    Iu    Iv    Iw    Ix    Iy    Iz   J    Ja    Jb    Jc    Jd    Je    Jf    Jg    Jh    Ji    Jj    Jk    Jl    Jm    Jn    Jo    Jp    Jq    Jr    Js    Jt    Ju    Jv    Jw    Jx    Jy    Jz   K    Ka    Kb    Kc    Kd    Ke    Kf    Kg    Kh    Ki    Kj    Kk    Kl    Km    Kn    Ko    Kp    Kq    Kr    Ks    Kt    Ku    Kv    Kw    Kx    Ky    Kz   L    La    Lb    Lc    Ld    Le    Lf    Lg    Lh    Li    Lj    Lk    Ll    Lm    Ln    Lo    Lp    Lq    Lr    Ls    Lt    Lu    Lv    Lw    Lx    Ly    Lz   M    Ma    Mb    Mc    Md    Me    Mf    Mg    Mh    Mi    Mj    Mk    Ml    Mm    Mn    Mo    Mp    Mq    Mr    Ms    Mt    Mu    Mv    Mw    Mx    My    Mz   N    Na    Nb    Nc    Nd    Ne    Nf    Ng    Nh    Ni    Nj    Nk    Nl    Nm    Nn    No    Np    Nq    Nr    Ns    Nt    Nu    Nv    Nw    Nx    Ny    Nz   O    Oa    Ob    Oc    Od    Oe    Of    Og    Oh    Oi    Oj    Ok    Ol    Om    On    Oo    Op    Oq    Or    Os    Ot    Ou    Ov    Ow    Ox    Oy    Oz   P    Pa    Pb    Pc    Pd    Pe    Pf    Pg    Ph    Pi    Pj    Pk    Pl    Pm    Pn    Po    Pp    Pq    Pr    Ps    Pt    Pu    Pv    Pw    Px    Py    Pz   Q    Qa    Qb    Qc    Qd    Qe    Qf    Qg    Qh    Qi    Qj    Qk    Ql    Qm    Qn    Qo    Qp    Qq    Qr    Qs    Qt    Qu    Qv    Qw    Qx    Qy    Qz   R    Ra    Rb    Rc    Rd    Re    Rf    Rg    Rh    Ri    Rj    Rk    Rl    Rm    Rn    Ro    Rp    Rq    Rr    Rs    Rt    Ru    Rv    Rw    Rx    Ry    Rz   S    Sa    Sb    Sc    Sd    Se    Sf    Sg    Sh    Si    Sj    Sk    Sl    Sm    Sn    So    Sp    Sq    Sr    Ss    St    Su    Sv    Sw    Sx    Sy    Sz   T    Ta    Tb    Tc    Td    Te    Tf    Tg    Th    Ti    Tj    Tk    Tl    Tm    Tn    To    Tp    Tq    Tr    Ts    Tt    Tu    Tv    Tw    Tx    Ty    Tz   U    Ua    Ub    Uc    Ud    Ue    Uf    Ug    Uh    Ui    Uj    Uk    Ul    Um    Un    Uo    Up    Uq    Ur    Us    Ut    Uu    Uv    Uw    Ux    Uy    Uz   V    Va    Vb    Vc    Vd    Ve    Vf    Vg    Vh    Vi    Vj    Vk    Vl    Vm    Vn    Vo    Vp    Vq    Vr    Vs    Vt    Vu    Vv    Vw    Vx    Vy    Vz   W    Wa    Wb    Wc    Wd    We    Wf    Wg    Wh    Wi    Wj    Wk    Wl    Wm    Wn    Wo    Wp    Wq    Wr    Ws    Wt    Wu    Wv    Ww    Wx    Wy    Wz   X    Xa    Xb    Xc    Xd    Xe    Xf    Xg    Xh    Xi    Xj    Xk    Xl    Xm    Xn    Xo    Xp    Xq    Xr    Xs    Xt    Xu    Xv    Xw    Xx    Xy    Xz   Y    Ya    Yb    Yc    Yd    Ye    Yf    Yg    Yh    Yi    Yj    Yk    Yl    Ym    Yn    Yo    Yp    Yq    Yr    Ys    Yt    Yu    Yv    Yw    Yx    Yy    Yz   Z    Za    Zb    Zc    Zd    Ze    Zf    Zg    Zh    Zi    Zj    Zk    Zl    Zm    Zn    Zo    Zp    Zq    Zr    Zs    Zt    Zu    Zv    Zw    Zx    Zy    Zz   \n \n \n\n \n \n Pages in category \"All disambiguation pages\" \n The following 200 pages are in this category, out of approximately 305,081 total.

Although architecturally undistinguished ( Pevsner Architectural Guides  describing it as \"frenetic  Jacobean \"), the house has been a favoured residence of the Royal family for over 150 years. The estate was bought in 1862 for  Albert Edward , Prince of Wales. Between 1870 and 1900 the house was rebuilt and Edward developed the wider property into one of the best sporting estates in England.  George\u00a0V  inherited it in 1910 and in 1932 made the first ever  Christmas broadcast  from the house. George died at Sandringham on 20 January 1936. The property passed to his son  Edward\u00a0VIII , and at the abdication, it was purchased by Edward's brother,  George\u00a0VI . As devoted to the house as his father, he died there on 6 February 1952. On the King's death, Sandringham was inherited by Elizabeth\u00a0II. The Queen spends much of the winter at the house, including the anniversary of her father's death and of her own accession.

He had previously been the 33rd  governor of New York , from 1899 to 1900, and then the 25th  vice president of the United States , from March to September\u00a01901. As a leader of the  Republican Party , he became a driving force for the  Progressive Era  in the United States in the early 20th century. In 1912, he ran for a third term as president. When he  could not secure the Republican nomination , he formed his own party, the  Progressive or \"Bull Moose\" Party , which drew enough votes away from the Republican nominee, incumbent President  William Howard Taft , to give their  Democratic  opponent  Woodrow Wilson  a  large victory in the electoral vote . Roosevelt was a distant cousin of the 32nd president,  Franklin D. Roosevelt , and the uncle of Franklin's wife  Eleanor Roosevelt . His face is depicted on  Mount Rushmore , alongside  George Washington ,  Thomas Jefferson  and  Abraham Lincoln .\n This picture is a  line engraving  of Roosevelt, produced around 1902 by the  Department of the Treasury 's  Bureau of Engraving and Printing  (BEP) as part of a  BEP presentation album  of the first 26 presidents.\n \n Engraving credit:  Bureau of Engraving and Printing ; restored by  Andrew Shiva \n \nRecently featured:  \n Macrocranion \n Ariadne auf Naxos \n Royal Albert Hall \n \n \n Archive \n More featured pictures \n \n \n \n \n \n Other areas of Wikipedia \n \n Community portal  \u2013 Bulletin board, projects, resources and activities covering a wide range of Wikipedia areas. \n Help desk  \u2013 Ask questions about using Wikipedia. \n Local embassy  \u2013 For Wikipedia-related communication in languages other than English. \n Reference desk  \u2013 Serving as virtual librarians, Wikipedia volunteers tackle your questions on a wide range of subjects. \n Site news  \u2013 Announcements, updates, articles and press releases on Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation. \n Village pump  \u2013 For discussions about Wikipedia itself, including areas for technical issues and policies. \n \n Wikipedia's sister projects \n .mw-parser-output #sister-projects-list{text-align:left;background:transparent;margin:1px}.mw-parser-output #sister-projects-list>div{width:32%;min-width:20em;white-space:nowrap;margin:0 1px;display:inline-block}.mw-parser-output #sister-projects-list>div>div{display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle;margin:1px 0;padding:4px}.mw-parser-output #sister-projects-list>div>div:first-child{min-width:50px;text-align:center} \n Wikipedia is hosted by the  Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization that also hosts a range of other  projects :\n \n \n \n       \n     Commons    Free media repository  \n \n \n       \n     MediaWiki    Wiki software development  \n \n \n       \n     Meta-Wiki    Wikimedia project coordination  \n \n \n       \n     Wikibooks    Free textbooks and manuals  \n \n \n       \n     Wikidata    Free knowledge base  \n \n \n       \n     Wikinews    Free-content news  \n \n \n       \n     Wikiquote    Collection of quotations  \n \n \n       \n     Wikisource    Free-content library  \n \n \n       \n     Wikispecies    Directory of species  \n \n \n       \n     Wikiversity    Free learning materials and activities  \n \n \n       \n     Wikivoyage    Free travel guide  \n \n \n       \n     Wiktionary    Dictionary and thesaurus  \n \n \n Wikipedia languages \n \n \n This Wikipedia is written in  English .

They are implemented by a  MediaWiki  feature that adds any page with a text like  [[Category: XYZ ]]  in its wikimarkup to the automated listing that is the category with name  XYZ . Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships.\n Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page. Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles (or other pages) that have been added to that particular category. There may also be a section listing the  subcategories  of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation.\n The term  category  does refer to both the title of a category page\u2014the  category pagename \u2014and the category itself. Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques. (See also the search box parameter \" incategory \".) The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about  displaying category trees  below.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Summary \n 2   Category page definition \n \n 2.1   Putting pages into categories \n \n \n 3   Working with category pages \n \n 3.1   Linking to category pages \n 3.2   Retrieving raw category information \n 3.3   Sorting category pages \n \n 3.3.1   Default sort key \n \n \n 3.4   Searching for pages in categories \n 3.5   Listing all categories \n 3.6   Displaying category trees and page counts \n 3.7   Moving and redirecting category pages \n 3.8   Hiding categories \n \n \n 4   Finding articles for a category \n 5   Categorizing \n \n 5.1   Categorizing templates \n 5.2   Categories and templates \n 5.3   Categorizing redirect pages \n 5.4   \"Related Changes\" with categories \n 5.5   Watching category additions and removals \n \n \n 6   See also \n 7   Notes \n \n \n\n Summary \n The MediaWiki software maintains tables of  categories , to which any editable page can be added. To add a page to a category, include \" [[Category: Category name ]] \" or \" [[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]] \" in that page's  wikimarkup . The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page.\n A category is usually associated with a  category page  in the \"Category:\"  namespace . [1]  A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as  subcategories .\n \n    The bottom of a Wikipedia article on  Chicken eyeglasses . At the very bottom of the page, below the References, navigation templates and external links are a series of links. These links are the categories used on the page, which include:  Category:Animal Welfare ,  Category:Animal equipment ,  Category:Eyewear , and  Category:Poultry farming  . By clicking on the category link at the bottom of the page, readers can navigate the Category tree. \n Category page definition \n A  category page  is any page in the Category namespace.  They each act as a category, and are termed a \"category\".  The category page has one section titled  Subcategories  listing other \"categories\", and one section titled  Pages , listing pages as categorized (in  other  namespaces). New categories are created by  creating a page  in the Category namespace.\n A category page can be edited like any other page. However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows:\n \n First a count and list of subcategories (other category pages belonging to the category) is shown, if any exist. The name of each subcategory is followed by a count of its own subcategories. These further subcategories are expanded in the display if the  \u25ba  sign alongside the subcategory is clicked (but this \" widget \" is only visible if your browser has  JavaScript  enabled). Note:  \u25ba   is shown if there are no further subcategories. The subcategory is collapsed again if  \u25bc  is clicked. \n Next a count and list of pages in the category (excluding subcategories and images) is shown. If the category has no members, a message to that effect is displayed. \n Next a count and list of image and other media files in the category appears, if any exist. These are shown with thumbnails. The first 20 characters of the file name are shown, with an ellipsis if that is not the full name; also the file size is shown. \n The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it (the name of the image).\n For the way in which the lists are ordered, see  Sorting category pages  below. The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key. These initial characters are displayed above the sections. To suppress these, make all sort keys start with a space.\n A category page can only display a limited number of items (currently 200). If more pages belong to the category, there will be a link to the next ones.\n  The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages. This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e. its  parent categories  (the categories of which it is a subcategory). Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the \"[[Category: Category name ]]\" or \"[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]\" syntax.\n \n Putting pages into categories  \n A page belongs to a category if the page's wikimarkup contains a declaration for that category. A category declaration takes the form  [[Category: Category name ]]  or  [[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]] . The declaration must be processed, i.e. it will not work if it appears between  <nowiki>...</nowiki>  or  <includeonly>...</includeonly>  tags, or in a comment. The declaration may however come from a  transcluded  page; see  Categories and templates  below.\n A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate  page title . If the category name begins with a lower-case letter it will be capitalized.\n In Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wikimarkup, but before any  stub  templates (which themselves transclude categories) and  interlanguage links .\n When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page (or possibly elsewhere, if a non-default  skin  is being used). This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wikimarkup. The category names are  linked  to the corresponding category pages. They appear as  redlinks  if the corresponding category page does not exist. If a user has enabled the  HotCat  gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page.\n Hidden categories are not displayed, except as described below under  Hiding categories .\n \n Working with category pages \n The following subsections are ordered from simple actions to more elaborate or rarer actions.\n \n Linking to category pages \n To link to a category page  without  putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: [[:Category: Category name ]]. Such a link can be  piped  like a normal wikilink. (The {{ cl }} template, and others listed on its documentation page, may sometimes be helpful.)\n \n Retrieving raw category information \n Raw information about the members of a category, their sortkeys and timestamps (time when last added to the category) can be obtained from the  API , using a query of the form:\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?cmtitle=Category: Category_name &action=query&list=categorymembers&cmlimit=500&cmprop=title|sortkey|timestamp \n Listings of up to 500 members are possible. If there are more members then the results will include text near the end like this:  <categorymembers   cmcontinue= \"page|NNNN|TITLE\"   /> .\n This can be added to the previous one, without quotation marks, for the next page of members:   ...&cmcontinue=page|NNNN|TITLE \n \n Sorting category pages \n By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace. English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with \u00c0, \u00c1, \u00c4, will be listed under heading A. Sorting is case-insensitive, so \"ABC\" comes after \"Abacus\".\n Unlike at  Special:Allpages  and  Special:Prefixindex , a space is treated as a space (coming before all other characters), not as an underscore.\n The English Wikipedia has  numerical sorting in categories . This means a page whose title begins with a number will be sorted according to the numeric value of the number (even if it is multiple digits). Thus \"9 dogs\", \"25 dogs\", and \"112 dogs\" will all appear under the \"0\u20139\" heading in numeric order. If the number includes a comma, space, or period, the sorting algorithm will only consider the part of the number before the separator.\n Each of the three lists (subcategories, pages, media files) is arranged in the order explained above (except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator \"Category:\" is not considered). If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name (sort key) for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list:\n \n [[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]] \n \n For example, to add an article called  Albert Einstein  to the category \"People\" and have the article sorted by \"Einstein, Albert\", you would type:\n \n [[Category:People|Einstein, Albert]] \n Unlike a  piped link  (which uses the same syntax), the sort key itself is not displayed to readers. It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page.\n It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page. For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see  WP:SORTKEY .\n \n Default sort key \n Shortcut WP:DEFAULTSORT \n See also:  WP:NAMESORT  and  WP:SORTKEY \n It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from  {{PAGENAME}}  by using the  magic word    {{DEFAULTSORT}} :\n \n {{DEFAULTSORT:new key}}\n \n In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags. This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also \"hidden\" (included by another template).\n \n Searching for pages in categories \n Further information:  Help:Searching \u00a7\u00a0Syntax \n See also:   \u00a7\u00a0Searching for articles in categories ,  Wikipedia:Category intersection , and  Wikimedia bug T3497 \"Hierarchical category system is urgently needed\" \n In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories. To search for articles in a specific category, type  incategory:\" CategoryName \"  in the search box.\n An \"OR\" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another. For example, enter\n \n incategory:\"Suspension bridges\"  OR incategory:\"Bridges in New York City\" \n to return all pages that belong to either (or both) of the categories, as  here .\n Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates. This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories.\n \n \n     \n \n Listing all categories \n Special:Categories  provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each; this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one.\n The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages. To list all existing category pages (regardless of whether they have members), use  Special:AllPages/Category: .\n \n Displaying category trees and page counts \n As described at  mw:Help:Magic words ,  {{PAGESINCATEGORY: Example }}  or  {{PAGESINCAT: Example }}  returns the number of pages in \"Category:Example\". Each subcategory counts as one page; pages in subcategories are not counted.\n The page  Special:CategoryTree  enables you to see the tree structure of a category (its subcategories, their subcategories and so on; the display of files and other member pages is optional).\n The  CategoryTree extension  can be used to display such a tree on any page. (This is sometimes done on the category page itself, if the category is split over multiple screens, to make all subcategories available on every screen.) The basic syntax is\n \n <categorytree> Category name </categorytree> \n to display just the subcategory tree, and\n \n <categorytree mode=pages> Category name </categorytree> \n to display member pages as well. They will be indicated by italics.\n Dapete's  category-visualizer  vCat  will render charts of the tree structure.\n You may also use  Template:Category tree  or  Template:Category tree all , instead.\n Warning:\n \n The following code  {{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{PAGENAME}}}}  will not work as expected when used in the wikitext or in a transcluded template in a category page whose title contains some ASCII punctuations. \n For legacy reasons,  {{PAGENAME}}  may return the page name with these characters being HTML-encoded using numeric character entities\u00a0: this still works for generating derived wikilinks or displaying page names, or when HTML-encoded this page name is used in a conditional \"#switch\", but PAGESINCATEGORY does not recognize the category name given in parameter if some characters are HTML-encoded (this is the case notably when the category name contains ASCII apostrophes  '  and a few other ASCII punctuations. (The same HTML-encoding is also applied to the values returned by  {{FULLPAGENAME}} ,  {{SUBPAGENAME}} , or  {{NAMESPACE}} ). \n In that case, as the category is not found by its HTML-encoded pagename, PAGESINCATEGORY will unexpectedly return 0 and not its effective number of member pages. \n A simple workaround is to transform these HTML-encoded characters back into standard UTF-8-encoded characters, by using the  {{titleparts:}}  parser function, like this: \n {{PAGESINCATEGORY:{{titleparts:{{PAGENAME}}}}}} \n \n \n Moving and redirecting category pages \n Categories can be moved  in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary. A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal  #REDIRECT\u00a0[[...]]  but a  {{ category redirect }} . Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted. For categories entirely populated through templates (see above), modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned. Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at  Wikipedia:Categories for discussion .\n Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a  {{ category redirect }}  template. See  Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Redirecting categories  for more on category redirects.\n \n Hiding categories \n When the  magic word   __HIDDENCAT__  is placed on a category page, that category becomes  hidden , meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category. On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the {{ hidden category }} template. The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages.\n However, hidden categories  are  displayed (although listed as hidden):\n \n on category pages (whether as parent categories or subcategories); \n at preview during editing; \n if the user has selected \"Show hidden categories\" in user preferences. \n Hidden categories are automatically added to  Category:Hidden categories .\n For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see  WP:HIDDENCAT .\n \n \n Finding articles for a category \n The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the \" What links here \"-tool on the category's main article.\n An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant  list  and checking its entries. Sometimes categories are about things that are  intersections of other categories  for which the  PetScan tool  can be used.\n More relevant articles may also be found linked in a category's main article and the articles already featured in the category \u2212 especially in their  \"See also\"  sections (if existent) and the automatically suggested \"RELATED ARTICLES\" below them.\n Furthermore, a category's superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category.\n Other ways to find relevant articles include  searching Wikipedia  for the category's topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes  \"  (with synonyms also in quotes and appended after an  OR ) and appending the word  wiki  or  Wikipedia  or  site:Wikipedia.org  to them.\n \n Categorizing \n Main page:  Wikipedia:Categorization \n Categorizing templates \n Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that  [[Category: Some-topic templates]]  should be placed on the template's documentation page (or inside  <noinclude>...</noinclude>  tags, if there is no documentation page), this is necessary to avoid  categorizing pages by template inclusion  (see below).\n \n Categories and templates \n A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside  <includeonly></includeonly>  tags on the template (e.g.  <includeonly>[[Category:category name]]</includeonly> ).  When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page.  This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories.\n Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page.  When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved.  When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the  job queue  to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list. Performing a   null edit  to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached.\n To add the template itself to the category page as well, omit the \"includeonly\" tags. To add the template to a category  without  categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between <noinclude>...</noinclude> tags, or add it to the  template documentation  page between  <includeonly></includeonly>  (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it).\n Parser functions  can be used to make the transcluded categories, or the sort key used in them, dependent on other variables, notably PAGENAME.\n \n Passing a category name as a parameter \n <includeonly>[[Category:{{{cat|default}}}]]</includeonly> or <includeonly>{{{cat|[[Category:default]]}}}</includeonly> If the user provides a parameter 'cat=XXX' the page will be categorized at the page  [[Category:XXX]] , otherwise it will be categorized at the page  [[Category:default]] . Calling the template with \"cat=\" (equal to nothing) disables putting the page in any category. \n Excluding non-article pages \n <includeonly>{{#if:{{NAMESPACE}} | | [[Category:XXX]]}}</includeonly> the variable NAMESPACE is null for mainspace articles.  For any space other than mainspace, this ParserFunction will produce an empty string, but for regular articles this will include the article in Category:XXX. \n On Wikipedia it is not recommended that templates be used to populate ordinary content categories of articles. See  Categorization using templates  in the categorization guideline.\n \n Categorizing redirect pages \n Main page:  Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects \n Redirect pages can be categorized and there are conventions how to do it. The redirect link must be first on the page. On a category page, redirects are listed in italics.\n \n \"Related Changes\" with categories \n For a category, the \" Related Changes \" feature, when applied to the corresponding category page, lists recent changes to the pages which are currently listed as belonging to a category. Where those pages are subcategories or image pages, only changes to their  editable parts  are listed.\n Notice that \"Related Changes\" does  not  show edits to pages that have been removed from the category.\n Also, \"Related Changes\" does  not  list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page (as it would normally, with a non-category page). If a workaround would be required, the links in question could be placed in a template and transcluded onto the category page.\n As usual \u2013 unlike with  watchlists  \u2013 recent changes to corresponding  talk pages  are  not  shown under \"Related Changes\". Pages one is watching are bolded on the list. This can help to find which pages in a given category one has on one\u00b4s watchlist.\n The  DynamicPageList (third-party)  extension provides a list of  last  edits to the pages in a category, or optionally, just the list of pages; the simpler  DynamicPageList (Wikimedia)  is installed on Meta, Wikinews,  Wikibooks  and Wikiversity; the extension  mw:Extension:DPLforum  is installed on Wikia.\n \n Watching category additions and removals \n Since  2016 , additions and removals from categories are available via the  \"Category changes\" filter  on recent changes pages, including  watchlists  and  Special:RecentChangesLinked . For example, category changes to articles in  Category:Cannabis stubs  can be  found here . You can monitor additions and removals from specific categories by adding the categories to your watchlist and making sure the \"Category changes\" filter is active. You can view changes to categories in your watchlist by  clicking here . Additional scripts with similar functionality are  User:CategoryWatchlistBot  and  User:Ais523/catwatch .\n \n See also \n MW:Help:Categories \n {{ Category TOC }} \n Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization \n Wikipedia:WikiProject Categories \n Wikipedia:Quick cat index \n Notes \n \n ^   The category itself is permanently created as soon as it has been saved on to any page.  Unless you create a  category page , it will display as a red link.  Unless you add another category to the category page, it will not be placed in the category tree.  Category pages are created like any other page.

In other words, disambiguations are paths leading to different articles which could, in principle, have the same title.\n For example, the word \"Mercury\" can refer to several different things, including an element, a planet,  and a Roman god.  Since only one Wikipedia page can have the generic name \"Mercury\",  unambiguous  article titles are used for each of these topics:  Mercury (element) ,  Mercury (planet) ,  Mercury (mythology) . There must then be a way to direct the reader to the correct specific article when the ambiguous word \"Mercury\" is referenced by linking, browsing or searching; this is what is known as  disambiguation . In this case it is achieved using  Mercury  as the title of a  disambiguation page .\n There are three principal disambiguation scenarios, of which the following are examples:\n \n The page at  Joker  is a  disambiguation page , leading to all the alternative uses of \"Joker\". It has a {{ Disambiguation }} template at the bottom. \n The page at  Rice  is about one usage, called the  primary topic , and there is a short message at the top of the page, called a  hatnote  and created with the {{ Other uses }} template, guiding readers to  Rice (disambiguation)  so other uses of the term can be found. \n The page at  Anita Hill  is about the primary topic, and there is only one other use.

This  category  contains  disambiguation pages :  non-article pages containing links to other Wikipedia articles and disambiguation pages.\n Disambiguation pages are added to  Category:Disambiguation pages  by placing the {{ Disambiguation }} template on the page itself. Other templates are available that place articles in more specific disambiguation subcategories. A page may also be  assessed  as \"disambiguation-class\" by various WikiProjects by including \"|class=Disambig\" in a WikiProject template on the talk page of the disambiguation page. This places the talk page in a subcategory of  Category:Disambig-Class articles .\n \n Notes \n Do not include this category manually in articles; the {{ Disambiguation }} template automatically does this. \n Do not add articles to these sub-categories or create additional sub-categories until you read  Manual of Style (disambiguation pages) \u2014most of the sub-categories do not comply with the MOS and will be removed. \n Links to disambiguation pages other than from the top of articles are usually mistakes. Find and fix them at  disambiguation pages with links . \n Lists of disambiguation pages:\n \n Links to disambiguating pages \n Links to (disambiguation) pages \n Multiple-place names \n

They consisted of schoolmates  Gladys Horton ,  Katherine Anderson  (now Schaffner),  Georgeanna Tillman  (later Gordon), Juanita Cowart (now Cowart Motley), and Georgia Dobbins, who was replaced by  Wanda Young  (now Rogers) prior to the group signing their first deal. They were the first major successful act of  Motown Records  after  the Miracles  and its first significantly successful girl group after the release of the 1961 number-one single, \" Please Mr. Postman \", one of the first number-one singles recorded by an all-female vocal group and the first by a Motown recording act.\n Founded in 1960 while the group's founding members performed together at their glee club at  Inkster High School  in  Inkster, Michigan , they signed to Motown's Tamla label in 1961. Some of the group's early hits were written by band members and some of Motown's rising singer-songwriters such as  Smokey Robinson  and  Marvin Gaye , who played drums on a majority of their early recordings. Despite their early successes, the group was eclipsed in popularity by groups like  the Supremes , with whom they shared an intense rivalry.\n Nevertheless, they managed a major comeback in 1966 with \" Don't Mess with Bill \", along with several other hits. They struggled with problems of poor promotion from Motown, health issues and substance abuse with Cowart the first to leave in 1963, followed by Georgeanna Tillman in 1965, and Gladys Horton in 1967. The group ceased performing together in 1969 and, following the release of  The Return of the Marvelettes  in 1970, featuring only Wanda Rogers, disbanded for good, with both Rogers and Katherine Anderson leaving the music business.\n The group has received several honors including induction into the  Vocal Group Hall of Fame , as well as receiving the Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. In 2005, two of the group's most successful recordings, \" Please Mr. Postman \" and \" Don't Mess with Bill \" earned million-selling Gold singles from the  RIAA . On August 17, 2013, in Cleveland, Ohio, at Cleveland State University, the Marvelettes were inducted into the 1st class of the Official Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   History \n \n 1.1   Origins and initial success \n 1.2   The departure of Georgeanna Tillman and renewed success \n 1.3   Decline \n 1.4   Later years \n \n \n 2   Legacy \n 3   Discography \n \n 3.1   Albums \n 3.2   Singles \n \n \n 4   Awards and recognition \n 5   References \n 6   Bibliography \n 7   External links \n \n \n\n History [ edit ] \n Origins and initial success [ edit ] \n The group that would become the Marvelettes formed at  Inkster High School  in  Inkster, Michigan , a suburb located west of  Detroit, Michigan  by fifteen-year-old glee club member  Gladys Horton  in the fall of 1960. Horton enlisted older glee club members  Katherine Anderson ,  Georgeanna Tillman , Juanita Cowart, and Georgia Dobbins (already a high school graduate) to join her. [1]  The members struggled to come up with a name for their new act until one of the members jokingly took a stab at their own singing abilities, saying \"we can't sing yet.\" Horton altered the saying to \"The Casinyets\".\n In 1961, the quintet, now called the Marvels, entered a talent show contest on the behest of their teacher and ended up finishing in fourth place. Though only the first three winners were offered a trip to audition for the fledgling Motown label, two of the girls' schoolteachers advised that they be allowed to audition too. Upon auditioning for Motown executives including  Brian Holland  and  Robert Bateman , they had a second audition with bigger staff including  Smokey Robinson  and the label president and founder,  Berry Gordy , who while impressed with their vocal styles advised them to come back with their own composition. Returning to Inkster, Georgia Dobbins contacted a local musician named William Garrett, who had an unfinished blues composition titled \" Please Mr. Postman \"; Garrett allowed Dobbins to use it as long as he received songwriting credit if the song became a hit. Despite having no previous songwriting experience, Dobbins took the song home and reshaped it overnight to reflect the teenage sound of  doo-wop . [2] \n Prior to returning to Motown, Dobbins left the group due to her growing family and her father, who advised her not to continue her career in show business. Dobbins' departure left Horton in full charge of the group. To replace her, Horton asked another Inkster graduate,  Wanda Young , to replace Dobbins. When the group returned and performed their composition, Gordy agreed to work with the group but under the advice that they change their name. Gordy renamed them The Marvelettes and signed the act to Motown's Tamla division in July 1961. The following month, the group recorded \"Please Mr. Postman\", which was polished by Brian Holland, Robert Bateman and  Freddie Gorman , another songwriting partner of Holland (before Holland became part of the Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland team), who moonlighted as a mailman, as well as the song \"So Long Baby\", sung by Wanda. Tamla issued \"Please Mr. Postman\" on August 21, 1961. [3]  The song then climbed to the top of the singles chart, reaching #1 that December. making them the first Motown act to have a #1 hit on the  Hot 100 .\n To follow up on this success, Motown had the group record \"Twistin' Postman\" to take advantage of the  twist dance craze  and the re-release of  Chubby Checker 's \" The Twist \". The song eventually peaked at #34 on the pop chart in early 1962. Before the end of 1961, Tamla issued the first Marvelettes album, also named  Please Mr. Postman , but it failed to chart. The group's next single, \" Playboy \", marked the second time one of their singles was written by a band member, this time by Gladys Horton. Like \"Postman\", the song was retooled by other writers and upon its release in early 1962, reached #7. A fourth hit, \" Beechwood 4-5789 \", co-written by  Marvin Gaye , reached #17. During 1962, two more albums would be issued by the band including  Smash Hits of '62  (later issued as  The Marvelettes Sing ) and  Playboy . Following the success of \"Beechwood\", R&B radio stations also frequently played the single's flip side, \"Someday, Someway\", which paid off sending the song to #8 on the R&B chart---their first double-sided hit.\n Due to their success, the group had to leave school in order to perform and despite the promise of tutors to help with their schooling, they were never granted any. Due to their young ages and Horton being an orphaned ward of the courts, they eventually were taken in by  Esther Gordy Edwards , who bused them to Motortown Revue shows. After several successful Top 40 recordings, the group released the modest success, \"Strange I Know\", which peaked at #49. In early 1963, the group was shortened to a quartet when Juanita Cowart opted to leave the band citing a mental breakdown---caused by stress from performing on the road and a mistake she made in describing the group's background during an appearance on  American Bandstand . Carrying on as a quartet, the group issued one of  Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland 's early compositions, \" Locking Up My Heart \", which peaked at #44. It was one of the first singles to feature Horton and Young in co-leads. The success of \"Locking\" was probably tested due to strong airplay by the song's B-side, the Young-led ballad \"Forever\", which also received a pop charting, peaking at #78. Then Berry Gordy composed and produced the single, \"My Daddy Knows Best\", but it was their lowest charting at the time, #67. [4] \n \n The departure of Georgeanna Tillman and renewed success [ edit ] \n By 1964, the majority of American vocal groups especially all female bands such as  the Shirelles  and  the Ronettes  started struggling with finding a hit after the arrival of  British pop and rock acts . In the meantime, other Motown girl groups such as  Martha and the Vandellas  and  the Supremes  were starting to get promoted by Motown staff with the Vandellas becoming the top girl group of 1963. The following year, the Supremes took their place as the label's top primary female group after a succession of hit recordings that year, culminating in the release of their second album,  Where Did Our Love Go , which Motown was able to promote successfully. 'Where Did Our Love Go' was turned down by the Marvelettes. [5]  Gladys recalls \"When they played 'Where Did Our Love Go' they played 'Too Many Fish In The Sea'. We picked 'Too Many Fish In The Sea' because it had all the music and all the bongos. We were all together and said at the same time we didn't want 'Where Did Our Love Go'.\"\n That year, the Marvelettes reached the top forty with the  Norman Whitfield  production, \" Too Many Fish in the Sea \", reaching #25 with the recording. By now, Motown had begun its charm school hiring choreographer  Cholly Atkins  and  Maxine Powell  to refine the label's acts. Atkins began polishing the Marvelettes' dance moves while Powell taught the group to be more graceful. telling them and every other Motown act that they would \"perform in front of kings and queens\". Meanwhile, two of the Marvelettes got married: Georgeanna Tillman married longtime boyfriend Billy Gordon of  the Contours  and Wanda Young married her longtime boyfriend  Bobby Rogers  of  the Miracles  changing her name to Wanda Rogers. By the end of 1964, Georgeanna Tillman, a longtime sufferer of  sickle cell anemia  was diagnosed with  lupus . By early 1965, struggling to keep up with their stringent recording sessions and touring schedules and her illnesses, a doctor of Tillman's advised her to leave performing for good. The rest of the Marvelettes carried on as a trio from then on.\n In mid-1965, Wanda Rogers took over as lead vocalist, as Motown producers felt Rogers' voice was more suitable for this role than Horton's. With Rogers as lead, the group had a hit with \" I'll Keep Holding On \", which reached #34 while \"Danger! Heartbreak Dead Ahead\" settled for a #61 showing but was #11 on the R&B chart. Later in 1965, the group released the  Smokey Robinson  composition, \" Don't Mess with Bill \", which brought the group back to the top ten reaching #7 and becoming their second single to sell over a million copies. From then on, with Robinson mainly in charge, most of the Marvelettes singles would feature Rogers on lead. In 1966, they had a modest success with \"You're the One\" and by the end of that year, they reached the top 20 with \" The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game \", which Smokey had to fight to get released. In 1967, the group recorded the  Van McCoy  composition, \" When You're Young and in Love \", which had been originally recorded by  Ruby & the Romantics . The song reached #23 in the U.S. and peaked at #13 in the UK, becoming their only British hit.\n \n Decline [ edit ] \n This section  does not  cite  any  sources .

( November 2013 )  ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) \n By 1967, Gladys Horton had reconsidered her involvement with the Marvelettes. After her first child, Sammie, was born with  cerebral palsy , Horton decided to leave the group entirely, doing so before the release of the hit \" My Baby Must Be a Magician \". The song peaked at #17 and was noted for featuring  the Temptations '  Melvin Franklin  providing the opening line. With Horton out,  Harvey Fuqua  introduced the group to Ann Bogan who became Horton's replacement. However, by the time Bogan joined the group in 1968, most of the musicians of Motown's early years had left, mainly due to financial disputes with the label. The group struggled with recordings after the release of \"Magician\", with Motown offering little to no promotion. The 1968 singles \"Here I Am Baby\" and \"Destination: Anywhere\" were only modestly successful, peaking at #44 and #63 respectively. The release of their 1969 album,  In Full Bloom , failed as did its only single, the remake of  Justine Washington 's \"That's How Heartaches Are Made\".\n Wanda Rogers, who had suffered from a number of personal problems for some time, became unreliable and difficult to work with. Concert scheduling was difficult as she sometimes failed to turn up for performances. In 1970, Rogers recorded songs for a solo album, produced by Smokey Robinson and including covers of earlier Motown recordings, which Motown decided to market as  The Return of The Marvelettes . As this album featured no other Marvelettes, original member Katherine Anderson refused to participate in appearing on the cover of the album due to what she felt was Motown's disrespect towards her and the group. The album was only a modest hit, reaching #50 on the R&B album charts and featured no charted hit singles. Following this, the group disbanded with Katherine Anderson settling briefly as a staff writer for Motown. After Motown moved to Los Angeles in 1972, Anderson and Rogers left the business altogether returning to Michigan with Anderson settling in her hometown of Inkster while Rogers moved to Southfield, Michigan. Meanwhile, Gladys Horton had moved to  Los Angeles  where she raised her three sons.\n \n Later years [ edit ] \n In January 1980, former Marvelette and original member Georgeanna Tillman died from complications of lupus, in her mother's house in Inkster, at the age of 36. Shortly afterwards, several of the former members filed suit against Motown, complaining of not receiving any royalties from their work. [6]  In 1989, Gladys Horton tried to reunite the original Marvelettes after being offered a contract with  Motorcity Records . Wanda Young was the only other Marvelette to agree to sing on the recording. Following this, Horton continued to perform, sometimes as \"Gladys Horton of the Marvelettes\". Due to a legal disagreement with Larry Marshak, who bought the Marvelettes' name from Motown after the label lost rights to the name, Horton would fight for years to retain ownership of the name. [7]  Marshak had several groups billing themselves as \"The Marvelettes\", but the women who portrayed themselves as the Marvelettes were much younger than the original lineup, and had not recorded on  any  of the Marvelettes' original Motown hits. [8] \n By 2006, thanks to the efforts of former  Supremes  singer  Mary Wilson , legislation had been launched in 33 states via  The Truth In Music Act  to prevent performers from using the name of a group that didn't have at least one original member, causing the groups who Marshak had hired as Marvelettes to bill themselves as \"Tribute to the Marvelettes\". [9]  Both Horton and Katherine Anderson began fighting to get back ownership of the name and were in their final stages of having the name returned to them when Horton died from a stroke at a California nursing home in January 2011. [10]  Following their exits from the Marvelettes, both Georgia Dobbins and Juanita Cowart remained in Inkster and settled into life outside the entertainment industry, with Cowart being active in her Inkster church choir. Wanda Rogers now lives with her daughter in  Westland, Michigan  while Katherine Anderson resides in Inkster and mentors several Detroit-area vocal groups. [6]  Ann Bogan, the latter-day member of the group, now lives in  Cleveland ,  Ohio  and became a part of the  New Birth  and their subgroup, Love, Peace & Happiness, before retiring to raise her children. All the surviving members of the group were recently interviewed for an episode of their lives on the  TV-One  show,  Unsung .\n \n Legacy [ edit ] \n This section  needs additional citations for  verification .

The following year, Horton appeared on the PBS concert special,  My Music: Salute to Early Motown , along with other Motown stars from the label's early years. Some of the group's recordings were later sampled for songs by rap musicians, most notably  Jay-Z 's song, \"Poppin' Tags\", sampled the group's 1970 cover of  Smokey Robinson 's composition, \" After All \", from his 2002 album,  The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse .\n In 1995, they were honored with the \"Pioneer Award\" at the Rhythm & Blues Foundation. In 2004, the group was inducted to the  Vocal Group Hall of Fame . In 2006, Marc Taylor issued the biography,  The Original Marvelettes: Motown's Mystery Girl Group . The group's story had been documented several years before in  Goldmine  magazine from a 1984 article.\n In 2007, the Marvelettes were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. [11] \n In 2009, as part of Motown's 50th Anniversary celebrations, a new limited-edition triple-CD set on the group entitled  The Marvelettes: Forever\u00a0\u2013 The Complete Motown Albums Vol. 1  was released. This featured the group's first six albums, some of which had never been released on CD.  The Marvelettes: Forever More\u00a0\u2013 The Complete Motown Albums Vol. 2 , which included their later albums and bonus material, was released in 2011.Their much-covered 1961 million-selling # 1 hit tune \"Please Mr Postman\" was inducted into the  Grammy Hall of Fame  in 2011. [12] \n The Marvelettes were nominated for 2013 induction into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . They became eligible for induction in 1987. Although they did not garner enough votes for induction, they made the ballot a second time for induction in the year 2015.

The program had an array of missions destined to reach Mars, and study it at relatively low costs. Each Scout project was to cost less than US$485 million. The  Phoenix [1]  lander and  MAVEN  orbiter were selected and developed before the program was retired in 2010. [2] \n \n Contents \n \n 1   First Scout mission \n 2   Second Scout mission \n 3   End of program \n 4   Previous candidates \n 5   Gallery \n 6   See also \n 7   References \n 8   External links \n \n \n\n First Scout mission [ edit ] \n Main article:  Phoenix (spacecraft) \n    Phoenix  dug these troughs on Mars, from which it is believed ice evaporated, as shown in this comparison \n The first  robotic spacecraft  in this program was  Phoenix , a  lander  originally intended for the canceled  Mars Surveyor  mission but adapted to the new mission.  Phoenix  was launched on August 4, 2007, and landed on the icy northern polar region of the planet on May 25, 2008.  Phoenix  was designed to search for environments suitable for  microbial   life on Mars , and to research the history of  water there . The 90-day primary mission was successful and the overall mission was concluded on November 10, 2008, after engineers were unable to contact the craft. The lander last made a brief communication with Earth on November 2, 2008.\n Phoenix  was one of four finalists selected out of 25 proposals. [3]  The four finalists were Phoenix, MARVEL,  SCIM  ( Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars ), and the  ARES  (\"Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Survey\") Mars airplane. [3]  SCIM was a sample return mission that would have used a free-return trajectory and aerogel to capture Mars dust and return it to Earth [3]  (see also: the  Stardust  mission). MARVEL was an orbiter that would have searched for volcanism as well as analyzed various components of the Mars atmosphere. [3]  The name is an acronym for  Mars Volcanic Emission and Life Scout , and it was intended to detect gases from life if it was there. [3]  ARES was an aircraft concept for Mars to study the lower atmosphere and surface. [3] \n The  Phoenix  lander basic design was further utilized for the Discovery' program  InSight  for Mars.\n \n Second Scout mission [ edit ] \n Main article:  MAVEN \n On September 15, 2008, NASA announced that it had selected  MAVEN  for as the second mission. [4] [5] [6]  This mission was budgeted at no more than US$475 million. [7]   The mission was launched on November 18, 2013 and it achieved Mars orbit on September 22, 2014.\n Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Mars lost most of its atmosphere billions of years ago.  The MAVEN orbiter is studying the current rate of atmospheric loss with an emphasis on the role of the  solar wind , whose rapidly moving ions and magnetic field may be responsible for Mars' current condition.\n \n   Mars -  escaping atmosphere  -  carbon ,  oxygen ,  hydrogen  (MAVEN;  UV ; October 14, 2014). [8] \n End of program [ edit ] \n In 2010, the NASA Science Directorate announced that the Mars Scout program would be incorporated into the  Discovery program , which was re-scoped to allow Mars missions to be proposed.  InSight  Mars lander won the next Discovery slot.\n \n Previous candidates [ edit ] \n Here are some previous missions that may have been considered for the Mars Scout Program: [9] [10] \n \n \n\n \n Mission Name\n \n Description\n \n \n The Great Escape (TGE)\n \n The mission would have directly determined the basic processes in Martian atmospheric evolution by measuring the structure and dynamics of the upper atmosphere. In addition, potentially biogenic atmospheric constituents such as  methane  would have been measured. The principal investigator is Alan Stern, Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado. Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, would have provided project management. [11] \n \n \n Artemis\n \n This mission would launch up to four saucer-shaped landers, two feet (0.61m) in diameter, from a \"mother ship\" orbiting Mars. Each would parachute onto the surface, analyzing the soil and atmosphere. Two of the four landers would be targeted at the polar regions.\n \n \n ARES \n \n This mission concept proposed to send an unmanned airplane into the Martian atmosphere to observe the planet. [12] [13] \n \n \n Chronos\n \n This mission would consist of a probe designed to melt through a polar ice cap using heated jets. It would travel up to 100 yards (91m) below the surface, analyzing the melted water to determine the climatic history of Mars. [14] \n \n \n KittyHawk\n \n This mission would create three or four winged gliders with approximately six-foot (1.83m) wingspans and would explore the  Valles Marineris  canyon system. The gliders would carry infrared spectrometers and cameras.\n \n \n MOO\n \n With infrared telescopes on Earth and a spectrometer on the  Mars Express Orbiter ,  methane  was discovered in the Martian atmosphere. The presence of methane on Mars is very intriguing, since as an unstable gas it indicates that there must be an active source of the gas on the planet. The latest research suggests that the methane destruction lifetime is as long ~4 Earth years and as short as ~0.6 Earth years. [15]  In either case, the destruction lifetime for methane is much shorter than the timescale (~350 years) estimated for photochemical ( UV  radiation) destruction. [15]  The Mars Organics Observer would use an orbiter to characterize the Martian methane: where it is being emitted, how much is being emitted and how often it is being emitted.\n \n \n The Naiades\n \n Named for  nymphs  of springs, lakes, and rivers from Greek mythology, this mission would send two landers to a region which likely holds groundwater. The landers would search for the groundwater using low-frequency electromagnetics and other instruments.\n \n \n SCIM \n \n A sample return mission that would briefly pass into the Martian atmosphere to scoop up about 1000 dust grains and a few liters of air without slowing from escape velocity.\n \n \n THOR \n \n Similar to NASA's  Deep Impact , this mission would impact two copper spheres into Mars' surface to create craters in a region known to have water ice, and maybe liquid water, a few meters under the surface. An accompanying orbiter would analyze the craters from orbit. Although this mission was not selected, ice was later observed in fresh natural impacts. [16] \n \n \n Urey\n \n This mission calls for a lander/rover pair designed to analyze the ages of rocks. It would be targeted for the  Cerberus Highlands  region, and would look for specific minerals to help scientists compare the cratering of Mars with that of the Moon.\n \n \n MARVEL\n \n Orbiter with spectrometers would look for volcanic emissions and life\n \n \n CryoScout\n \n Melt probe for ice caps\n \n \n Pascal\n \n 24 mini weather stations.

Marvel Gymnasium Former names Brown Gymnasium, 1927-38 Location Elmgrove Ave Providence, RI 02906 Owner Brown University Operator Brown University Capacity 3,000 Construction Broke ground 1927 Opened December 16, 1927 Closed 1989 Demolished 2002 Architect Clarke & Howe Tenants Brown University Bears (Basketball, squash, wrestling & fencing) \n Marvel Gymnasium  was a 3,000-seat multipurpose gymnasium in  Providence, Rhode Island .  It was home to the  Brown University  Bears basketball team as well as other teams.  The gymnasium included a basketball court and seating, a second-floor running track, squash and handball courts, a wrestling room, a boxing room, and a fencing room.\n The building was located at Aldrich Field, located on Elmgrove Avenue across from  Brown Stadium .  The land for Aldrich Field was a gift to the University from brothers Charles and Henry Aldrich, both alumni of Brown.  The fa\u00e7ade's clock face read \"A-L-D-R-I-C-H-F-I-E-L-D\" instead of the regular numbers, with the \"R\" being in place of the 12.  The bronze statue of \"Bruno,\" the  Brown bear mascot , was located just to the south of the main entrance on a pedestal containing a piece of  slate  said to have been from the spot where Roger Williams landed in what would become Providence in 1636. After Marvel Gym was closed, the statue was moved to the College Green, where it originally stood.\n On October 7, 1938, the building was rededicated to the memory of Frederick W. \"Doc\" Marvel, class of 1896, a longtime athletic director.  The building was in use until 1989, when the  Pizzitola Sports Center  opened at the Brown Athletic Conference.  It was then closed and stood dormant until 2002, when it was demolished, well past its usefulness and becoming dangerously dilapidated.  There are now practice fields on the site.\n \n External links [ edit ] \n \" Mavel Gymnasium \" entry in  Encyclopedia Brunoniana \n Coordinates :  41\u00b050\u203234\u2033N   71\u00b023\u203230\u2033W \ufeff / \ufeff 41.842775\u00b0N 71.391671\u00b0W \ufeff /  41.842775; -71.391671 \n \n v t e Brown Bears men's basketball Venues \n Marvel Gymnasium  (1927\u20131989) \n Pizzitola Sports Center  (1989\u2013present) \n Rivalries \n In-state Division I schools \n People \n Head coaches \n Seasons \n 1900\u201301 \n 1901\u201302 \n 1902\u201303 \n 1903\u201304 \n 1904\u201305 \n 1905\u201306 \n 1906\u201307 \n 1907\u201308 \n 1908\u201309 \n 1909\u201310 \n 1910\u201311 \n 1911\u201312 \n 1912\u201318 \n 1918\u201319 \n 1919\u201320 \n 1920\u201321 \n 1921\u201322 \n 1922\u201323 \n 1923\u201324 \n 1924\u201325 \n 1925\u201326 \n 1926\u201327 \n 1927\u201328 \n 1928\u201329 \n 1929\u201330 \n 1930\u201331 \n 1931\u201332 \n 1932\u201333 \n 1933\u201334 \n 1934\u201335 \n 1935\u201336 \n 1936\u201337 \n 1937\u201338 \n 1938\u201339 \n 1939\u201340 \n 1940\u201341 \n 1941\u201342 \n 1942\u201343 \n 1943\u201344 \n 1944\u201345 \n 1945\u201346 \n 1946\u201347 \n 1947\u201348 \n 1948\u201349 \n 1949\u201350 \n 1950\u201351 \n 1951\u201352 \n 1952\u201353 \n 1953\u201354 \n 1954\u201355 \n 1955\u201356 \n 1956\u201357 \n 1957\u201358 \n 1958\u201359 \n 1959\u201360 \n 1960\u201361 \n 1961\u201362 \n 1962\u201363 \n 1963\u201364 \n 1964\u201365 \n 1965\u201366 \n 1966\u201367 \n 1967\u201368 \n 1968\u201369 \n 1969\u201370 \n 1970\u201371 \n 1971\u201372 \n 1972\u201373 \n 1973\u201374 \n 1974\u201375 \n 1975\u201376 \n 1976\u201377 \n 1977\u201378 \n 1978\u201379 \n 1979\u201380 \n 1980\u201381 \n 1981\u201382 \n 1982\u201383 \n 1983\u201384 \n 1984\u201385 \n 1985\u201386 \n 1986\u201387 \n 1987\u201388 \n 1988\u201389 \n 1989\u201390 \n 1990\u201391 \n 1991\u201392 \n 1992\u201393 \n 1993\u201394 \n 1994\u201395 \n 1995\u201396 \n 1996\u201397 \n 1997\u201398 \n 1998\u201399 \n 1999\u201300 \n 2000\u201301 \n 2001\u201302 \n 2002\u201303 \n 2003\u201304 \n 2004\u201305 \n 2005\u201306 \n 2006\u201307 \n 2007\u201308 \n 2008\u201309 \n 2009\u201310 \n 2010\u201311 \n 2011\u201312 \n 2012\u201313 \n 2013\u201314 \n 2014\u201315 \n 2015\u201316 \n 2016\u201317 \n 2017\u201318 \n 2018\u201319 \n 2019\u201320 \n \n \n \n This article about a sports venue in Rhode Island is a  stub .

Hurley,  USNR , in command.\n \n Service history [ edit ] \n U.S. Navy, World War II, 1944-1945 [ edit ] \n Completing a brief  shakedown  at  Little Creek ,  Virginia ,  Marvel  got underway on 19 August 1944 for Naval Operating Base  Bermuda . Into the mid-autumn of 1944, she operated from St. George's Bay, Bermuda,  sweeping  for  mines  and conducting  antisubmarine  patrols to ensure safe passage into the eastern terminus of the southern  transatlantic   convoy  route. She returned to Virginia on 9 November 1944, and for the next two months conducted similar patrols in the  Hampton Roads  area.\n On 17 January 1945,  Marvel   weighed anchor  and began a two-and-a-half month cruise to  Kodiak ,  Territory of Alaska . Steaming via  Coco Solo  in the  Panama Canal Zone ,  San Diego ,  California , and  Seattle ,  Washington , she arrived at Kodiak on 31 March 1945. On 2 April 1945 she departed for the  Shumagin Islands , arriving at  Baralof Bay  on 3 April 1945. There she conducted local exercises.\n Selected for transfer to the  Soviet Navy  in  Project Hula  \u2013 a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at  Cold Bay , Alaska, in anticipation of the  Soviet Union  joining the  war against Japan  \u2013  Marvel  proceeded to Cold Bay in the spring of 1945 to begin familiarization training of her new Soviet crew. [3] \n \n Soviet Navy, 1945-1960 [ edit ] \n Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew,  Marvel  was  decommissioned  on 21 May 1945 [1]  at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under  Lend-Lease  immediately. [1]  Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, [1]  she was designated as a  tralshik  (\"minesweeper\") and renamed  T-274 [2]  in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky  in the Soviet Union, where she served in the  Soviet Far East . [3] \n In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947,  United States Secretary of the Navy   James V. Forrestal  informed the  United States Department of State  that the  United States Department of the Navy  wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the  Cold War  broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \"returned\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery. [4]  The Soviets converted  T-272  into a  naval trawler  in 1948 [ citation needed ]  and renamed her  Passat , [ citation needed ]  and never returned 'her to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \"fleet minesweeper\" (MSF) and redesignated her  MSF-262  on 7 February 1955.\n \n Disposal [ edit ] \n T-274  was scrapped in 1960. [3]  Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept  Marvel  on its  Naval Vessel Register  until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

According to Russell, Project Hula ships were decommissioned by the U.S. Navy simultaneously with their transfer to and commissioning by the Soviet Navy \u2013 see photo captions on p. 24 regarding the transfers of various  large infantry landing craft  (LCI(L)s) and information on p. 27 about the transfer of  USS\u00a0 Coronado \u00a0 (PF-38) , which Russell says typified the transfer process \u2013 indicating that  Marvel ' s U.S. Navy decommissioning, transfer, and Soviet Navy commissioning all occurred simultaneously in a single ceremony on 21 May 1945.

The MARVEL  (Mississippi Aerophysics Research Vehicle with Extended Latitude)  was a single-engined  pusher   monoplane  fitted with a  boundary layer control  system. The first all-composite aircraft, it carried out its initial program of research on behalf of the  US Army  in the late 1960s, and was rebuilt in the 1980s as a proof-of-concept for a utility aircraft.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Development and design \n 2   Operational history \n 3   Specifications (XV-11A) \n 4   See also \n 5   References \n \n \n\n Development and design [ edit ] \n The Department of Astrophysics and Aerospace Engineering at the Mississippi State University had been involved in a program of research into  boundary layer control  on behalf of the  Office of Naval Research  and the  US Army  since the early 1950s, carrying out trials on a modified  Schweizer TG-3  glider, a  Piper L-21  and a  Cessna O-1 . [1] [2]   Based on the results of these studies, the US Army awarded the Department a contract to develop a new STOL research aircraft the  XV-11 MARVEL  (\"Mississippi Aerophysics Research Vehicle, Extended Latitude\"). [3] \n The resultant design was a shoulder-winged  monoplane  powered by a single  Allison T63   turboprop  engine driving a  pusher   ducted propeller . The aircraft's structure was made completely of fiberglass, making the Marvel the first example of an all-composite aircraft. [4]  The boundary layer control system used a blower driven by the engine to draw suction through more than one million tiny holes in the wings and fuselage, while instead of conventional  flaps  the Marvel used a form of  wing warping  to deflect the wing trailing edges to vary the wing's  camber . [1]  The aircraft's tail surfaces were attached to the duct around the propeller, extending behind the duct. The undercarriage, of the so-called \"Pantobase\" configuration, with tandem wheels fitted within two sprung wooden pontoons, was meant to allow operation from rough surfaces, or even from water. [3] [5] [6]   It was constructed mainly of  fiberglass , with steel used for reinforcement and as heat shields around the engine. [7] \n \n Operational history [ edit ] \n    The XV-11 Marvel on display in August 2000 \n The aircraft's wing and ducted propeller were tested on a piston-engined test bed, the  XAZ-1 Marvelette . [2] [8]   The full-sized Marvel was built by the Parsons Corporation based at  Traverse City ,  Michigan , [1]  making its first flight on December 1, 1965. [5]  It successfully completed a 100-hour flying program for the US Army in 1969, where it demonstrated good STOL performance, taking off within 125\u00a0ft (38\u00a0m), and although the boundary layer control system was not as effective as hoped, it still provided a large amount of test data. Following the completion of the US Army testing in 1969, it was sent to storage awaiting further tests. [3] [6] [9] \n The Marvel was brought out of storage as a proof-of-concept demonstrator of a STOL utility aircraft for  Saudi Arabia . It was fitted with a more powerful (420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW)) engine and longer span (36\u00a0ft 10\u00bd\u00a0in (11.24\u00a0m) wings, first flying in this form as the Marvel II on August 17, 1982. After initial tests in the United States, the Marvel II was shipped to  Ta\u2019if , Saudi Arabia, carrying out a short test program which showed that its landing gear was unsuitable for operating from soft sand and it was still underpowered, after which it returned to Mississippi. [3] [10] \n In 2000, the aircraft was displayed at  EAA Airventure  promoting the Mississippi State Department of Aerospace Engineering. In 2004, the XV-11A was donated to the  Southern Museum of Flight  at the  Birmingham International Airport  in  Alabama .

All ships were built to an identical - Admiralty - design, hence the class name. 18 other vessels which were officially included within the 'M' class were built to variant designs by three specialist builders - 10 by  Yarrow , 6 by  Thornycroft  (who also built another 6 to the standard Admiralty design), and 2 by  Hawthorn Leslie ; however, these are listed in other articles.\n The Admiralty design was based on the preceding  L class  but modified to produce an increase in speed by approximately 6  knots  (11\u00a0km/h; 6.9\u00a0mph). All ships built to the Admiralty design had three identical narrow, circular  funnels  (this did not apply to the 18 ships built by the specialist yards).\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Ships of the pre-war (1913\u201314) Programme \n 2   Ships of the Emergency War Construction Programme \n \n 2.1   1st War Programme \n 2.2   2nd War Programme \n 2.3   3rd War Programme \n 2.4   4th War Programme \n 2.5   5th War Programme \n \n \n 3   See also \n 4   Notes \n 5   Bibliography \n \n \n\n Ships of the pre-war (1913\u201314) Programme [ edit ] \n Six vessels were built under the 1913\u201314 Naval Programme.

Three further ships were projected under the 1914-15 Naval Programme - and named  Marksman ,  Menace  and  Monitor ; however these three ships were cancelled before being contracted to any specific builder, in favour of two  Marksman -class leaders .\n \n Ships of the Emergency War Construction Programme [ edit ] \n All the following vessels were ordered in five batches as part of the War Emergency Programme. Wartime builds omitted the cruising turbines originally specified and carried by the pre-war sub-group.

The cave was known by the Osage Indians in the early 16th century, after a tribe member fell through the cave's main entrance, a sinkhole. There is evidence that in 1541 the Spanish explored the cave, but the first recorded expedition was in 1869, led by Henry T. Blow. The unofficial Stone County chapter of  Bald Knobbers , a local group of vigilantes, were rumored to have taken people to the top of Roark Mountain, and thrown them in the sink hole.\n Marvel Cave was originally called Marble Cave, after explorers in 1882 saw what they thought was  marble  on the cave's ceiling. This started the Marble Cave Mining Company, although later it was realized that there was never any marble in the cave. The Marble Cave Mining Company ceased all operations after only four and a half years. William Lynch purchased the cave in 1889, and soon after opened the cave to the public. In 1950, Hugo Herschend leased the cave for 99 years. The Herschends made renovations to the cave, and later opened a theme park,  Silver Dollar City , on the surface above the cave. Marvel Cave is known for being one of the largest caves in Missouri, having one of the largest cave entry rooms (the Cathedral Room) of any cave in North America, and for being one of the longest running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   History \n \n 1.1   Osage Indians \n 1.2   The Bald Knobbers \n 1.3   Early explorers \n 1.4   Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company \n 1.5   Marmaros \n 1.6   The Lynches \n 1.7   The Herschends \n \n \n 2   Tours \n \n 2.1   Traditional tours \n 2.2   Lantern tour \n \n \n 3   Rooms and passages \n 4   Notable formations \n 5   Life in the cave \n 6   See also \n 7   References \n 8   External links \n \n \n\n History [ edit ] \n Osage Indians [ edit ] \n Legend says in the early 16th century, the local Osage Indians were on a bear hunt, chasing two black bears along the White River until one went up a tree for safety. But a well placed arrow took it out.  They continued to chase the other bear up Roark Mountain, and the bear fell onto a ledge in the sinkhole. The hunting party didn't want to all jump down to kill the bear and have to drag it back up so, a brave young tribe member climbed down to the ledge with his hunting dog and knife. He stabbed the bear and the bear lunged back. The bear, dog and the boy fell through the sinkhole landing in the Cathedral Room. The Indians then looked down the hole and saw nothing. They heard strange sounds; echoing sounds of their voices, bats flying around, water trickling and they felt warm air, all of which made them think it was an evil place. The Indians thought they had found the entrance to Hades [ citation needed ]  and named the cave the Devil's Den.  They marked trees around the Devil's Den with their danger sign (a sideways V), and never returned. [1] \n \n The Bald Knobbers [ edit ] \n According to Silver Dollar City park legend, a local group of vigilantes who later turned into outlaws called the Bald Knobbers were known for throwing people through the sinkhole into Devil's Den around the mid 19th century. Though it's likely that roving Bushwhackers and outlaws would've undoubtedly chosen to dispose of their victims through this sinkhole, the Bald Knobbers did not form until 1883 (starting-up in neighboring Taney County), were replaced by an unofficial chapter in 1886 within nearby Christian County, with unofficial chapters in other counties (including Stone County where the cave is located) later than that.\n However, though there is no written evidence to substantiate it, it's possible that Stone County's unofficial Bald Knobbers used the cave for various uses sometime in 1889, between the time the mining operations ceased and late October of that year when it was purchased for sightseeing tours.\n \n Early explorers [ edit ] \n There is evidence that the Spanish explored the cave in 1541, hoping to uncover riches and possibly the fountain of youth. [1]  There is a legend that the Spanish buried gold in the cave. The first known expedition was in 1869 and lead  Henry T. Blow  of  St. Louis , a lead mining magnate. He explored the cave with six other miners. [1]  One by one, the miners lowered themselves down into the sinkhole. They carried lanterns for light and spent hours studying the cave walls carefully searching for signs of mineral deposits. They went as far as the Shoe Room, because on one side was the Gulf of Doom, which they believed was the bottomless pit after throwing rocks down the Gulf of Doom and hearing no sound. On the other side was the Cloud Room, which was filled to the ceiling with bat guano. The miners returned to the surface late that evening having failed to discover the lead ore they sought, but were convinced that the flat ceiling of the Shoe Room contained marble. Their report gained the interest of area locals who decided to name the cave, Marble Cave.\n No more expeditions took place until 1882 when another group of entrepreneurs, led by Mr. T. Hodges Jones and Truman S. Powell of Barton County, entered the cave in hopes of finding lead. Jones and Powell found huge amounts of  guano  and the flat ceiling, which they also believed to be marble.\n \n Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company [ edit ] \n In 1884, Mr. T. Hodge Jones bought the property and, with several of his friends, formed the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company to mine the marble from the cave. The company hired a geologist, and it was proved that what looked like marble on the ceiling of the Shoe Room was really limestone. To keep the company alive they mined out the guano and sold it for $700 a ton. The guano was used for gunpowder and fertilizer. The miners filled ore carts with guano, then the carts were pulled by donkeys to the Cathedral Room, and the carts were lifted out of the cave by a pulley system. In 1889, after four and a half years,all the guano was mined out. Marble Cave Mining, Co. closed all operations.\n \n Marmaros [ edit ] \n Marmaros (Greek for Marble) was a small town that formed along with the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company in 1884. It was originally called Marble City. It was located on the rough hilltop near the cave and recorded a plat map at the courthouse in  Galena, Missouri . Marmaros contained a hotel,  general store , pottery shop, white oak furniture factory, and was rumored to have a saloon. The town turned into a  ghost town  in 1889 after the Marble Cave Mining, Co. closed. When the Lynches bought the cave, the town was burned to the ground by the local group of  vigilantes  known as the Bald Knobbers.\n \n The Lynches [ edit ] \n On October 30, 1889, William Henry Lynch, a Canadian miner and dairyman, purchased the cave and the square mile of land around the cave where Marmaros was located for $10,000. [1]  After coming to Marvel Cave, he found that Marmaros was burnt to the ground. Lynch, with the aid of his family, proposed to open the cave to sightseers. The Lynches began operation of the sightseeing venture in 1894 with a grand celebration and a few visitors. [1]  The cave has remained open since, making it one of the oldest continuously running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.\n When William Lynch died in 1927, ownership of the cave passed to his daughters. Shortly thereafter, the name of the cave was changed to Marvel Cave. [1]  The Lynch family operated the cave for over fifty years.\n \n The Herschends [ edit ] \n A Chicago  vacuum cleaner  salesman, Hugo Herschend, purchased a 99-year lease on the cave in 1950, from The Lynch sisters. [1] \n After Hugo Herschend's death in 1955, his wife Mary took over the day-to-day operations of the cave. With the aid of her two sons, Jack and Peter, Mary Herschend was able to make vast improvements to the cave. They added concrete paths and stairs to the cave, and a tower from the sinkhole to the top of the debris pile. Also, they added a  narrow gauge   funicular  (cable-pulled) railway in 1957, whose trains pulled visitors a distance of 218 feet (66\u00a0m), [1]  from the depths of the cave up to the surface. Before building the cable train, the  Army Corps of Engineers  said that it could not be built, because a cable train can not make a turn like the one the Herschends planned.  The Herschends built it anyway, and it is still in operation to this day.\n Once the cable train was in operation, the Herschends decided to recreate the mining village Marmaros, for tourists waiting to go on a tour. It opened in 1960, and is called  Silver Dollar City .\n In 1972 Genevieve Lynch died and bequeathed the cave to the  College of the Ozarks  and the First Presbyterian Church of Branson. The Herschends continue to operate the property under lease. [2] \n \n Tours [ edit ] \n Currently there are two different tours offered: The Traditional Tour and The Lantern Tour.\n \n Traditional tours [ edit ] \n The first guided tours in the cave were in 1894 run by the Lynches. They lasted 8 hours and were by candle or lantern. Visitors climbed through the sink hole on a 100 feet (30\u00a0m) ladder down to the top of the pile. Then you were instructed to slide down the pile to the bottom. You received a candle to guide your way. The tours included the Egyptian Room (now the Shoe Room), the Lakes Passage, and you saw formations such as the Great White Throne (now the Liberty Bell), and the Spring Room Sentinel (now just the Sentinel). After the Hershends started tours in 1950, they removed the wooden stairs, and added concrete stairs and paths through the cave. Current tours last for about an hour, and are limited to 60 people.\n \n Lantern tour [ edit ] \n In 2006, Marvel Cave started offering The Lantern Light Tour. In this tour the electric lights are turned off in the cave and lanterns are given to each member of the tour. Unlike the regular tours which are free, this tour costs $16.12, and is limited to 20 people. The tour has been extended into the Mammoth Room, making it the first tour to incorporate this room in more than fifty years. One is also able to see both the summer and fall sections if the Waterfall Room is not flooded.  The tour lasts about an hour and a half.  The guide focuses on the history and folklore of the cave and is able to explain more information about the cave due to the small group setting of the tour.\n \n Rooms and passages [ edit ] \n The Cathedral Room  is one of the largest cave entrance rooms found in North America. The room measures 204 feet (62\u00a0m) high, 225 feet (69\u00a0m) wide, and 411 feet (125\u00a0m) feet long. Entrance to the cave is made through a sink hole which is 94' deep. Two large openings are at the bottom of the sink. Rocks, trees, dirt and animals falling through the sinkhole and falling boulders from the ceiling throughout the centuries has left a debris pile measuring 124 feet (38\u00a0m) tall. This pile is sometimes referred to as the Underground Mountain. On July 7, 1963 an underground altitude record was set by  Don Piccard  by flying a  hot air balloon  around the massive room. Later, in 1994 five hot air balloons were flown simultaneously in the Cathedral Room in celebration of the 100th year anniversary of giving cave tours. \n The Mammoth Room  is where the majority of the bats choose to hibernate. In 1869 Spanish style ladders, small trees with notches carved in them, were found in the Mammoth Room by Henry Taylor Blow, one of the first known explorers of the cave. \n The Dungeon  is a passage located next to the Cathedral Room. The entrance can be made through a small crevice located 80 feet (24\u00a0m) below the sinkhole entrance. Blood like stains cover the walls due to the abundance of  iron oxide , which led some early cave guides to claim the Dungeon Passage a torture place of the Spanish Explorers. The passage has an entrance through the Mammoth Room as well. \n The Lakes Passage  is past the Mammoth Room and contains two lakes named Genevieve and Miriam, after the daughters of William Lynch. Divers have explored the lakes and have found several under water passages. The deepest they went was around 110 feet (34\u00a0m). The two lakes are long and were once thought to be a river, known as No-Name River. Genevieve later led an expedition of the passage and discovered that there was an end to the water filled passages. Her party found that the cave continued up hill. The passage has been explored, but not entirely. The last room explorers have discovered is a tall terminal dome pit that contains two small water falls that makes climbing to the top very difficult. Many have tried and failed. \n The Spring Room  A small crevice behind a tall column known as the Sentinel lies the Spring Room. The room is covered in orange calcite and contains several waterfalls that looks and sounds like rain fall. Legends have spread about the water being magical, possibly the  Fountain of Youth . \n Serpentine Passage  connects the Cathedral Room and the Egyptian Room. The route displays perfectly the way that water used to flow through the cave passages. \n Egyptian Room / Shoe Room  Genevieve and Miriam Lynch had a fondness for the study of Egypt and this flat smooth desert like room reminded them of a pyramid. Within the rocks of the room they saw King  Tutankhamen 's  Sarcophagus , The  Sphinx 's Nose, Arrow Head Entry, and  Cleopatra 's Sandal. The ceiling is shaped like a large sandal or shoe, leading some to call it the Shoe Room. The flat smooth ceiling was once mistaken for Marble. \n The Gulf of Doom  is located under the \"heel\" of the shoe print ceiling. The great pit was once thought to be bottomless. Rocks would be thrown into the darkness, but no sound would ever resonate. The superstitious thought it was a gateway to the underworld, when the true reason was simple: large amounts of clay and bat guano were covering the bottom of the gulf's floor over 100' below. \n Cloud Room or Cloud Land  has a rough porous ceiling. The ceiling is made of dolomite and looks like low hanging clouds. \n Tall Man's Headache / Fat Man's Misery  is a passage with a low ceiling and narrow sides, the smallest passage in the guided tour. It is about 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) 7 inches (18\u00a0cm) tall, and 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) long. \n The Harold Bell Wright Passage  is before the Waterfall Room during fall and winter tours.  Harold Bell Wright , the author of  The Shepherd of the Hills ,  was friends of the Lynches, and stayed in the cave for days at a time. There is a cabin located in the passage where Harold Bell Wright stayed. Some people believe that he wrote parts of his book in the cave. Inside the cabin he painted a picture of his book's character, Maggie. The Cabin that is there now is a replica, not the original, although it uses some of the same wood. \n The Waterfall Room  is the lowest room on the tour, 505 feet (154\u00a0m) below the surface. The source of the water is from the underground stream named The Lost River. This room can flood to the ceiling during times of rain. \n The Mud Passage  is located between the Waterfall Room and the Mystic Pool Room, named for the mud in the passage during early tours, which has since been cleared out. \n The Mystic River Passage  is a small water filled passage that eventually opens up to the second largest room in the cave. The room is called the T Room and is in the shape of the letter T. The cave extends beyond the T Room, but the passage becomes much smaller and narrower than before. To enter the passage one must lie on their back and keep their face above the water. The passage is extremely tight and filled with mud and water causing many to call it the \"Sewer Pipe.\" The end of the passage has not been reached. \n The Mystic Pool Room  is the room in which the Mystic River Passage is located. \n The Elves Chamber  is the top of the terminal dome pit extending upwards from the Mystic Pool Room. Numerous  calcite  formations can be seen in this area of the cave. The ceiling is filled with long  stalactites  and covered in  helictites . The entrance to the Cable Train Tunnel is located in the Elves Chamber making it the last room on the tourist trail of Marvel Cave. \n Notable formations [ edit ] \n Blondie's Throne  is a  flowstone  located near the end of the tour of the cave, the name comes from its obvious resemblance to a throne. The name \"Blondie\" comes from a story about a boy (Charles Smallwood) who was lost in the cave in the late 19th or early 20th century. He was later found sleeping near this formation, and the first thing they saw in the candlelight was his blonde hair. While there is a legend that some substance in the cave turned his hair blonde, it is more likely that the boy was known for his blonde hair. \n The Liberty Bell  is a 55 feet (17\u00a0m) tall  stalagmite , Although it started out on the ceiling near the Serpentine Passage as a  stalactite . It gets its name from its shape, and the crack on its side. The crack was made when it fell from the ceiling, and now it is on the cave floor. After falling, it continued to grow on the floor. It is hollow and can fit four to five adults inside. It was originally called \"The Great White Throne\". \n The Sentinel  is a column located in the Cathedral Room, right in front of the passage that leads to the Spring Room. It used to be referred as \"The Spring Room Sentinel\" Tour guides also say that it is the only thing supporting the dome of the Cathedral Room. \n .mw-parser-output .mod-gallery{display:table}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-default{background:transparent;margin-top:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-left{float:left}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-right{float:right}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-none{float:none}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery-collapsible{width:100%}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .title,.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .main,.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .footer{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .title>div{display:table-cell;text-align:center;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .main>div{display:table-cell}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .caption{display:table-row;vertical-align:top}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .caption>div{display:table-cell;display:block;font-size:94%;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .footer>div{display:table-cell;text-align:right;font-size:80%;line-height:1em}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .gallerybox .thumb img{background:none}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .bordered-images img{border:solid #eee 1px}.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .whitebg img,.mw-parser-output .mod-gallery .gallerybox div{background:#fff!important} Marvel Cave rock formations \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n Blondie's Throne\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n The Sentinel\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n The Liberty Bell\n \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n \n Life in the cave [ edit ] \n    Gray bat in a  hibernaculum .

For for the company itself, see  Marvel Entertainment . \n Toy Biz The last logo utilized by Marvel Toys under the Toy Biz brand Trade name Marvel Toys Formerly Charan Toys Former type Subsidiary Industry Toys Fate Defunct Founded 1988 in  Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada Founder Charan Industries Defunct 2007 Headquarters New York City ,  New York ,  United States Products Games, toys and children's vehicles; dolls and stuffed toys Owner Isaac Perlmutter Avi Arad Parent Marvel Entertainment \n Toy Biz  (formerly stylized as  ToyBiz  and later re-branded to  Marvel Toys ) was an American toy company which later became a subsidiary of  Marvel Enterprises/Entertainment . It was best known for producing  action figures ,  stuffed toys , and  role-playing games  of various licensed brands and characters.\n The company originated in  Montreal ,  Quebec , as Charan Toys. In 1988, Charan Toys was renamed to ToyBiz and became an American firm. In 1990, it obtained the master toy license for the  Marvel Entertainment Group , and by 1993 became partially owned by Marvel. [1]  In 1998, ToyBiz merged with Marvel Entertainment Group to bring it out of bankruptcy, with the two companies merging and creating  Marvel Enterprises . Whilst the original 'ToyBiz' was absorbed into Marvel Enterprises, Marvel Enterprises called its main toy subsidiary 'Toy Biz' (with the space in-between the two words); as consumers were familiar with the Toy Biz brand. In 2005, Marvel Enterprises was renamed to Marvel Entertainment to reflect the  Marvel Cinematic Universe , in addition to this, Toy Biz replaced its name with 'Marvel Toys' on some of its non-Marvel figure lines to reflect the universe name change. The subsidiary would then become 'Marvel Toys' outright by the end of 2006. \n Due to Marvel Entertainment's bankruptcy, the company became financially unable to continue to run the Marvel Toys subsidiary at its current level, and  Hasbro  purchased the master toy license for Marvel Entertainment characters, releasing its first products in January 2007. Marvel Toys attempted to survive with non-Marvel owned characters throughout 2007, though still faced financial problems. The website for Marvel Toys became inactive in late 2007.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   History \n \n 1.1   Late 19th century to 1997 \n \n 1.1.1   Charan Toys (Canadian company) \n 1.1.2   Toy Biz (American company) \n \n \n 1.2   1998 to 2007 \n \n 1.2.1   Toy Biz as a subsidiary \n 1.2.2   Marvel Entertainment licensing agreement to Hasbro \n \n \n \n \n 2   See also \n 3   References \n 4   External links \n \n \n\n History [ edit ] \n Late 19th century to 1997 [ edit ] \n Charan Toys (Canadian company) [ edit ] \n The company's original forerunner was a Canadian company, Chantex, Inc., which started in the late 19th century. Started by the Zuckerman family, the business grew from $.16 million in sales to sales of $4.5 million in 1980. [1]  In 1980, Chantex merged with Earl Takefman's Randim Marketing, Inc., a school supply manufacturer and wholesaler to become Charan Industries Inc. [ citation needed ]  Its Charan Toy, Inc. subsidiary became a leading licensing toy company in 1985. [1]  In addition to toys, Charan used a very broad approach to implementing its brands across all lines, including acquiring a hockey equipment brand in the mid-1980s. [2]  \n \n Toy Biz (American company) [ edit ] \n In 1990, Charan, including the Toy Biz subsidiary, was purchased by businessman Ike Perlmutter. [3]  In 1993, Toy Biz made a deal for \"exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free licenses\" of  Marvel Characters  for 46 percent of Toy Biz equity. [4]   Avi Arad , a toy designer and comic book fan joined Toy Biz that same year. [3]   \n Toy Biz continued licensing outside brands, including  Hercules: The Legendary Journeys  and  Xena: Warrior Princess  action figures based on the  Action Pack  television series shown on many  New World  television stations. Also, agreements with  Gerber [5]  and  NASCAR  were acquired. [ citation needed ] [1]  In 1995, Toy Biz acquired  Spectra Star , Inc. [6]  and  Quest Aerospace  Education, Inc., both toy companies. [1]  Toy Biz started up its Classic Heroes candy division in 1996, which sold candy/toy combinations using mainly Marvel characters. [ citation needed ]  The company also entered the electronic learning aids (ELA) segment of the toy industry in 1996 with a licensing agreement with  Apple Computer . [1]  \n Toy Biz partially acquired Marvel Entertainment Group. [7]  In the late 1990s, Marvel Entertainment Group filed for bankruptcy and became the subject of a battle for control in bankruptcy court. [8] [9]  The company was salvaged in 1997 and merged with Toy Biz in 1998. [10] [7]  The new company became  Marvel Enterprises , and Toy Biz became a division of the new company. [11] [4]   \n \n    Toy Biz and Marvel Entertainment Group merged to form  Marvel Enterprises . This entity became the holdings company for Marvel assets. \n 1998 to 2007 [ edit ] \n Toy Biz as a subsidiary [ edit ] \n In 1999, Toy Biz ventured into  professional wrestling . Toy Biz to acquired the master toy license of  World Championship Wrestling  (WCW). After two years, the license deal was cut short, due to WCW being purchased by the World Wrestling Federation/WWF (Now World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE) in 2001. [ citation needed ]  The company also licensed products for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. [ citation needed ]  \n In 2001, Marvel Enterprises licensed the rights to the 'Toy Biz' name to a Hong Kong-based toy manufacturer, Toy Biz Worldwide Ltd. Toy Biz also outsourced much of the manufacturing to Toy Biz Worldwide. [12]  The deal was ended abruptly in 2006. [13] [14] \n In September 2005, Marvel Enterprises changed its name to Marvel Entertainment to reflect the corporation's expansion into creating the  Marvel Cinematic Universe . As a result of this change, Toy Biz would replace some branding of its figure lines, and replace it with a 'Marvel Toys' logo instead. This only applied to non-Marvel Comics products, as Marvel Comics characters would still continue to use the Toy Biz branding. [ citation needed ] \n \n Marvel Entertainment licensing agreement to Hasbro [ edit ] \n In January 2006, Marvel Entertainment signed a five-year licensing agreement with  Hasbro Inc.  for $205 million, giving Hasbro the right to make toys and games based on Marvel Comic licenses. As a result of this, Marvel Entertainment prematurely terminated its agreement with Toy Biz Worldwide Ltd, by a year. [14]  As a result of the early termination, Marvel Entertainment paid Toy Biz Worldwide a penalty of between $13-16 million USD. Marvel Entertainment officially stopped using the \"Toy Biz\" branding and name from 1 January 2007, and the division was rebranded as Marvel Toys. [ citation needed ] \n Throughout 2007, the division struggled to stay afloat without the Marvel Comic characters. The company introduced a series called the Legendary Comic Book Heroes \u2013 making action figures of non-Marvel Comic characters, though it suffered with poor sales. The company also furthered its TNA Wrestling, Code Lyoko and Curious George lines. Marvel Entertainment quietly began to close the division. In late 2007, the company's website shut down.

Marvel Studios is best known for the production of the  Marvel Cinematic Universe films , which has grossed over $22.5 billion at the global box office as of 2019, with the film  Avengers: Endgame  grossing $2.8 billion worldwide. [5] \n Marvel Studios has released  23 films since 2008 within the Marvel Cinematic Universe , from  Iron Man  (2008) to  Spider-Man: Far From Home  (2019). These films all share  continuity  with each other, along with the  One-Shots  produced by the studio and the  television shows  produced by  Marvel Television . \n In addition to the  Marvel Cinematic Universe , Marvel Studios was also involved with the production of other  Marvel -character film franchises that have exceeded $1 billion in North American box office revenue: the  X-Men  and  Spider-Man  multi-film franchises. \n Marvel Studios is also developing television series which will air on  Disney+ .\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Background \n \n 1.1   Timely era \n 1.2   Marvel Entertainment Group era \n \n \n 2   History \n \n 2.1   Marvel Films \n 2.2   Marvel Studios \n 2.3   Licensing films \n 2.4   Production \n 2.5   Disney conglomerate subsidiary (2009\u2013present) \n 2.6   Disney Studios subsidiary \n \n \n 3   Character rights \n 4   Marvel Knights \n 5   Units \n \n 5.1   Marvel Music \n \n \n 6   Logo \n 7   Production library \n \n 7.1   Films \n 7.2   Television \n \n 7.2.1   Animated \n 7.2.2   Live action \n \n \n \n \n 8   See also \n 9   References \n 10   External links \n \n \n\n Background [ edit ] \n Timely era [ edit ] \n During what is known as Marvel's  Timely era , Captain America was licensed out to  Republic Pictures  for a  serial  just for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character, and portrayed the character using a gun. [6] \n \n Marvel Entertainment Group era [ edit ] \n In the late 1970s up to the early 1990s,  Marvel Entertainment Group  (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on  Marvel Comics characters . One of Marvel's superheroes,  Spider-Man , was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated timeframe. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters had been optioned, including the  Fantastic Four ,  X-Men ,  Daredevil ,  Hulk ,  Silver Surfer , and  Iron Man . [7]  A  Howard the Duck   film  made it to the screen in 1986, but was a  box-office flop . MEG was purchased by  New World Entertainment  in November 1986 [8]  and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It released  The Punisher (1989)  before MEG was sold to  Ronald Perelman 's  Andrews Group . Two other films were produced:  Captain America  (1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, and  The Fantastic Four  (1994), not intended for release. Marvel's rival  DC Comics , on the other hand, had success licensing its properties  Superman  and  Batman  into successful film franchises. [9] \n \n History [ edit ] \n Marvel Films [ edit ] \n    The logo used under the Marvel Films branding. \n Following Marvel Entertainment Group's (MEG) ToyBiz deal in 1993,  Avi Arad  of  ToyBiz  was named President and CEO of Marvel Films division and of New World Family Filmworks, Inc., a New World Entertainment subsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group. [10] [11]   Marvel Productions  became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films including Marvel Films Animation. [10] [12] [13]  Marvel Films Animation shared  Tom Tataranowicz  with New World Animation as head of development and production. [14]  New World Animation ( The Incredible Hulk ),  Saban  ( X-Men ) and Marvel Films Animation ( Spider-Man ) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996\u20131997 season. [15]  It was Marvel Films Animation's only production. [13] [16]  By the end of 1993, Arad and  20th Century Fox  struck a deal to make a film based on the X-Men. [17] \n New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by Andrews Group to  News Corporation / Fox  as announced in August 1996. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil and Silver Surfer to be on  Fox Kids Network  and produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season of  The Incredible Hulk  for  UPN . [15] [18] \n \n Marvel Studios [ edit ] \n In August 1996, Marvel created Marvel Studios, an incorporation of Marvel Films, due to the sale of  New World Communications Group, Inc. , Marvel's fellow Andrews Group subsidiary in film and television stations, to News Corporation/Fox. Filing with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold Toy Biz stocks, which Marvel had started and took public in February 1995. [7] [19]  Toy Biz filed an offering of 7.5\u00a0million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150\u00a0million. Toy Biz sought to sell 1 million shares, and Marvel sought to sell 2.5\u00a0million shares. [20] \n Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of Toy Biz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control  pre-production  by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, \"When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period.\" [7]  Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally. [21]  In the following December, Marvel Entertainment Group went through a  reorganization plan , including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment. [22]  By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual films  X-Men  (2000),  Daredevil  (2003),  Elektra  (2005) and  Fantastic Four  (2005). Unproduced projects included  Prince Namor , based on the character  Namor  and to be directed by  Philip Kaufman , and  Mort the Dead Teenager , based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson and  Mort  creator  Larry Hama . [23]  \nMarvel was developing a Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network to premiere in fall 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made. [24] [25] [26] \n In October 2019, it was reported that Marvel Studios' president Kevin Feige had been promoted to become Marvel Chief Creative Officer. Under this structure,  Marvel Television  and Marvel Family Entertainment will be moving under Marvel Studios, with  Marvel Entertainment  president reporting to Feige.  [27] \n \n Licensing films [ edit ] \n The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios was  Blade , based on the vampire hunter  Blade . The film was directed by  Stephen Norrington  and starred  Wesley Snipes  as Blade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide. [28]  \n Blade  was followed by  X-Men , which was directed by  Bryan Singer  and was released on July 14, 2000.  X-Men  grossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide. [29]   Blade  and  X-Men  demonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public. [30] \n Leading up to  X-Men ' s release, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functional  Artisan Entertainment , successful with the low-budget  The Blair Witch Project , for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including  Captain America ,  Thor ,  Black Panther ,  Iron Fist , and  Deadpool . Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include TV series, direct-to-video films and internet projects, would be co-owned. [31]  By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment's  Ultimate Marvel  imprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development. [32] \n The next film licensed from Marvel Studios was  Spider-Man  by  Columbia Pictures , directed by  Sam Raimi  and starring  Tobey Maguire  as Spider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide. [33]  The early success of  Spider-Man  led the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, \"Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence.\" [34]  According to a Lehman Brothers analysis, the Studios made only $62 million for the first 2 Spider-Man movies. [35]  Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the movie, but was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footings. [36]  In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for Sub-Mariner and  Prime  with  Universal Studios . [37] \n In contrast to the original storylines of DC Comics' Superman and Batman films, Marvel films were more directly inspired by their comics, copying from them set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue. [30] \n In 2003,  David Maisel  approached Arad about earning Marvel more for their films. Maisel, Arad and Perlmutter met leading to Maisel being hired as President and COO. The studio's office, then on Santa Monica Boulevard, was small with a dozen or so staff members.  Kevin Feige , later to become CEO, was then a junior executive generating script notes to the licensed studios. [36]  In January 2003, Marvel, The SCI FI Channel and  Reveille Productions  agreed to develop two pilot films based on  Brother Voodoo  and  Strikeforce: Morituri . [38] \n Partnering with  Lionsgate  in 2004, Marvel Studios planned to enter the direct-to-DVD market with  eight animated films  with  Lionsgate Home Entertainment  handling distribution. [39] [40]  The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan. [36]  Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President, Home Entertainment & TV Production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate. [41] \n \n Production [ edit ] \n In 2004, David Maisel was hired as chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance movies. [42]  Marvel entered into a  non-recourse debt  structure with  Merrill Lynch  that was collateralized by certain movie rights to a total of 10 characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel got $525\u00a0million to make a maximum of 10 movies based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters were:  Ant-Man ,  The Avengers ,  Black Panther ,  Captain America ,  Cloak & Dagger ,  Doctor Strange ,  Hawkeye ,  Nick Fury ,  Power Pack  and  Shang-Chi . [43]   Ambac  insured the movies would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the movie rights collateral. [35] \n Initially Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, as Universal owned the film rights to both  Hulk  and  Namor [44] [45]  during that time. Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks with  Paramount Pictures . In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each movie, demanding that Marvel finance 1/3 of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand. [36]  On September 6, 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Also, the parent company changed its name from Marvel Enterprises, Inc. to Marvel Entertainment, Inc. to reflect the change to self-production. [43] \n The studio moved to a new location over a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Beverly Hills. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to  Isaac Perlmutter . [36]  In October 2005, Michael Helfant joined the studio as president and chief operating officer. [46] \n In November 2005, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man from  New Line Cinema . Marvel revealed that it had regained the film rights to Hulk from Universal in February 2006, [47]  in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights to  The Incredible Hulk  and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-produced  Hulk  films. [48]  In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production. [49]  Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped the  Black Widow  motion picture project it had since 2004 giving the rights back to Marvel. [50] \n Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of movie releases and strength of characters in the movie line up. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO. [42]  In March 2007, David Maisel was named Chairman and Kevin Feige was named President of Production as  Iron Man  began filming. [51] \n In January 2008,  Marvel Animation  was incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate and  Nickelodeon . [41]  The company in March agreed to a five picture basic cable distribution with  FX  for Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk movies with the additional movies to be named later. [52]  In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease with  Raleigh Studios  to host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four movies on the studios' slate, including  Iron Man 2  and  Thor , at their Manhattan Beach facilities. [53]  By September 2008, Paramount added to its domestic film distribution contract 5 additional Marvel movies' foreign distribution. [54] \n In 2009, Marvel attempted to hire a team of writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther,  Cable , Iron Fist,  Nighthawk , and  Vision . [55]  In early 2009,  Sony  returned all Spider-Man television rights (including live action) in exchange for an adjustment to the movie rights. [56] \n \n Disney conglomerate subsidiary (2009\u2013present) [ edit ] \n    Former typeface logo (2013\u20132016) \n On December 31, 2009,  The Walt Disney Company  purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4\u00a0billion. Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any preexisting deals with other film studios for the time being, [57]  although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects with their own  studio  once the deals expired. [58] \n In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20\u201340 million movies based on properties such as Doctor Strange,  Ka-Zar , Luke Cage,  Dazzler , and Power Pack. [59]  Kevin Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox. [60] \n In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a  television division  within Marvel Studios, headed up by  Jeph Loeb  as Executive Vice President, [61]  under which Marvel Animation would be operated. [62]  On October 18,  Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures  acquired the distribution rights for  The Avengers  and  Iron Man 3  from Paramount Pictures [63]  with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on the films. [64] \n On August 22, 2011, at Disney's behest, the Studio dismissed most of its marketing department: Dana Precious, EVP of Worldwide Marketing; Jeffrey Stewart, VP of Worldwide Marketing and Jodi Miller, Manager of Worldwide Marketing. Disney markets Marvel's films. [65]  In April 2012, The Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios and  DMG Entertainment  announced an agreement to co-produce  Iron Man 3  in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney. [66] \n In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from  Manhattan Beach  Studios Media Campus to  The Walt Disney Studios  in  Burbank, California . [67] \n On July 2, 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to  Iron Man ,  Iron Man 2 ,  Thor  and  Captain America: The First Avenger  from Paramount. [68] [69]  In September 2014,  TNT  acquired the cable rights for  Avengers: Age of Ultron ,  Captain America: Civil War , and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008. [70] \n \n Disney Studios subsidiary [ edit ] \nIn August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed into Walt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairman  Alan Horn  instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control. [71] [72]   Fast Company  ranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list. [73]      The Frank G. Wells Building, the studio's home as of April 2017 [74] [75]  As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of the Frank G. Wells Building at the Disney studio lot. [74] [75] \n In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming service  Disney+ , to be centered on \"second tier\" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series included  Loki  and  Scarlet Witch , with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio productions\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development. [76]  In October 2019, Marvel Studios President  Kevin Feige  was given the title of Chief Creative Officer, Marvel, and will oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television and Marvel Family Entertainment (animation), with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner. [77] \n \n Character rights [ edit ] \n Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of their characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with the  X-Men [17] ,  Fantastic Four ,  Spider-Man ,  Daredevil  and later  Iron Man ,  Thor ,  Hulk ,  Black Widow ,  Luke Cage ,  Punisher ,  Blade ,  Ghost Rider ,  Man-Thing ,  Black Panther  and  Deadpool  among others.\n In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in  Captain America: Civil War  and Sony releasing  Spider-Man: Homecoming  produced by Feige and Pascal on July 7, 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films. [78]  In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of the  MCU television series , as it was \"very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed.\" [79] \n In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in a third standalone film (produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film. [80]  Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.

[90]  However, Feige expanded in July 2014 saying that Marvel Studios, not Universal Pictures or  Legendary Pictures , could make a Namor film, \"but it's slightly more complicated than that. Let's put it this way \u2013 there are entanglements that make it less easy. There are older contracts that still involve other parties that mean we need to work things out before we move forward on it. As opposed to an Iron Man or any of the Avengers or any of the other Marvel characters where we could just put them in.\" [91]  In June 2016, Quesada again stated that, to his knowledge, the film rights to Namor had returned to Marvel. [92]  In October 2018, Feige noted the character could appear in the MCU, with the studio still deciding how it would use the character. [93] \n \n \n Ego, the Living Planet\n \n 2016\n \n 20th Century Fox\n \n 20th Century Fox was able to change the powers of  Negasonic Teenage Warhead  for  Deadpool  by giving Marvel Studios the rights to  Ego the Living Planet , who appears in  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 .

Marvel paid in exchange for the film's negative so Constantin could sub-license the rights to 20th Century Fox. On December 14, 2017, Disney  agreed to purchase  20th Century Fox's parent company  21st Century Fox , after it spins off some of its businesses. [96]  The deal was completed on March 20, 2019.

The first film produced under the Marvel Knights banner was  Punisher: War Zone , the 2008 release that  rebooted  the  Punisher franchise .

The company was incorporated on September 9, 2005  [105]  and announced as a label for releasing music related to Marvel's film and television productions in 2009. [106]  According to the company, Marvel Music has released albums in conjunction with Disney's  Hollywood Records . [107] \n In 2014,  Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1  became  certified Gold \u2014and subsequently  certified Platinum \u2014by the  Recording Industry Association of America . It also became the first  soundtrack album  in history to top the  Billboard  200  chart while consisting entirely of previously released songs. [108] \n \n Logo [ edit ] \n Play media    Logo animation (2013\u20132016), featuring the first Marvel Studios fanfare (0:28). \n Starting with the release of  Spider-Man  in 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its \"flipbook\"  production logo , created by Imaginary Forces. [109]  This logo was accompanied with music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of  Thor: The Dark World , again created by Imaginary Forces. Kevin Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within The Walt Disney Company, it \"felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features\" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that \"We didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\" [110]  Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, ultimately choosing 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\" [109] \n The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the  Marvel Cinematic Universe  through  Captain America: Civil War . With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by  Brian Tyler , who wrote the scores to  Iron Man 3 ,  Thor: The Dark World , and  Avengers: Age of Ultron . [110]  It was featured on the films  Thor: The Dark World ,  Captain America: The Winter Soldier , and  Guardians of the Galaxy .\n In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by  Doctor Strange  and  Spider-Man: Homecoming  composer  Michael Giacchino . The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings, but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. [111]  It was first seen in front of  Doctor Strange . [112]  The updated logo was created by Perception, who were first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo. Feige specifically requested Perception \"to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.\" The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed \"How to Build a Universe\", which \"was designed to pay tribute to [the film making] process by touching on\" how a film's origins is inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial \"flipbook\" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes \"various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays\", with Perception picking \"both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.\" To add in the concept art images, Perception looked \"through a massive archive of concept art and \"The Art Of\u2026\" books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.\" Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the \"vault\" \"where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the \"Marvel\" logotype.\" [113] \n A modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017  D23  Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU. [114]  The logo debuted with  Avengers: Infinity War  on April 26, 2018 and was used again in  Ant-Man and the Wasp . With the release of  Captain Marvel , the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor of  Stan Lee ; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film. [115]  The logo was altered, replacing the characters with  Stan Lee \u2019s MCU cameos, accompanied by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". [116]  The Perception logo underwent a slight alteration again with the release of  Avengers: Endgame . The Marvel Studios fanfare was not used during the intro, but rather the song  Dear Mr. Fantasy  by the English rock band  Traffic . The clips from preceding films shown during the intro sequence were also slightly changed to reflect the events of  Avengers: Infinity War , only showing characters and clips from films featuring the Avengers who survived Thanos' Decimation at the end of the aforementioned film.

The MARVEL  (Mississippi Aerophysics Research Vehicle with Extended Latitude)  was a single-engined  pusher   monoplane  fitted with a  boundary layer control  system. The first all-composite aircraft, it carried out its initial program of research on behalf of the  US Army  in the late 1960s, and was rebuilt in the 1980s as a proof-of-concept for a utility aircraft.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Development and design \n 2   Operational history \n 3   Specifications (XV-11A) \n 4   See also \n 5   References \n \n \n\n Development and design \n The Department of Astrophysics and Aerospace Engineering at the Mississippi State University had been involved in a program of research into  boundary layer control  on behalf of the  Office of Naval Research  and the  US Army  since the early 1950s, carrying out trials on a modified  Schweizer TG-3  glider, a  Piper L-21  and a  Cessna O-1 . [1] [2]   Based on the results of these studies, the US Army awarded the Department a contract to develop a new STOL research aircraft the  XV-11 MARVEL  (\"Mississippi Aerophysics Research Vehicle, Extended Latitude\"). [3] \n The resultant design was a shoulder-winged  monoplane  powered by a single  Allison T63   turboprop  engine driving a  pusher   ducted propeller . The aircraft's structure was made completely of fiberglass, making the Marvel the first example of an all-composite aircraft. [4]  The boundary layer control system used a blower driven by the engine to draw suction through more than one million tiny holes in the wings and fuselage, while instead of conventional  flaps  the Marvel used a form of  wing warping  to deflect the wing trailing edges to vary the wing's  camber . [1]  The aircraft's tail surfaces were attached to the duct around the propeller, extending behind the duct. The undercarriage, of the so-called \"Pantobase\" configuration, with tandem wheels fitted within two sprung wooden pontoons, was meant to allow operation from rough surfaces, or even from water. [3] [5] [6]   It was constructed mainly of  fiberglass , with steel used for reinforcement and as heat shields around the engine. [7] \n \n Operational history \n    The XV-11 Marvel on display in August 2000 \n The aircraft's wing and ducted propeller were tested on a piston-engined test bed, the  XAZ-1 Marvelette . [2] [8]   The full-sized Marvel was built by the Parsons Corporation based at  Traverse City ,  Michigan , [1]  making its first flight on December 1, 1965. [5]  It successfully completed a 100-hour flying program for the US Army in 1969, where it demonstrated good STOL performance, taking off within 125\u00a0ft (38\u00a0m), and although the boundary layer control system was not as effective as hoped, it still provided a large amount of test data. Following the completion of the US Army testing in 1969, it was sent to storage awaiting further tests. [3] [6] [9] \n The Marvel was brought out of storage as a proof-of-concept demonstrator of a STOL utility aircraft for  Saudi Arabia . It was fitted with a more powerful (420\u00a0hp (313\u00a0kW)) engine and longer span (36\u00a0ft 10\u00bd\u00a0in (11.24\u00a0m) wings, first flying in this form as the Marvel II on August 17, 1982. After initial tests in the United States, the Marvel II was shipped to  Ta\u2019if , Saudi Arabia, carrying out a short test program which showed that its landing gear was unsuitable for operating from soft sand and it was still underpowered, after which it returned to Mississippi. [3] [10] \n In 2000, the aircraft was displayed at  EAA Airventure  promoting the Mississippi State Department of Aerospace Engineering. In 2004, the XV-11A was donated to the  Southern Museum of Flight  at the  Birmingham International Airport  in  Alabama .

[1]  It later became a subsidiary of New World Entertainment and eventually of  News Corporation  ( Fox Entertainment Group ).\n Marvel Productions produced animated television series, motion pictures, and television specials such as  Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends ,  The Incredible Hulk ,  My Little Pony: The Movie ,  The Transformers: The Movie , and  G.I.

Animation . [2] [3]  Freleng's business partner and DFE co-founder  David H. DePatie  continued to work for the company under the Marvel banner for several years until his retirement. [4] \n \n Marvel Productions (1981\u20131993) [ edit ] \n Marvel Productions opened its Los Angeles studio in 1981. [3]  In 1984,  Margaret Loesch  joined Marvel Productions as President and Chief Executive Officer. [5]  Marvel Comics Group, owned by Cadence Industries Corporation since 1968, was sold to  New World Pictures  in 1986 along with Marvel Productions and incorporated as Marvel Entertainment Group (MEG). [6] \n With New World having cash flow problems, MEG was sold in January 1989 to  Andrews Group , a MacAndrews and Forbes subsidiary, owned by  Ronald Perelman . However, New World kept Marvel Productions and merged it with its own television business. [6]  MP moved their offices from Van Nuys to West Los Angeles in May 1989. [1]  New World's problems continued, which led them to also be acquired by the Andrews Group within the year. [7]  Loesch left for Fox Kids in 1990. [8]  In December 1992, New World formed New World Family Filmworks and New World Action Animation, headed by Marvel Productions president  Rick Ungar , to produce $20 million worth of family entertainment programming. [9] [10] \n \n New World Animation (1993\u20131996) [ edit ] \n Marvel Productions was renamed New World Animation in November 1993. [11]  In 1994, Marvel and New World started up  Marvel Films  including Marvel Films Animation. [6] [12] [13] [14]  New World Animation ( The Incredible Hulk ),  Saban Entertainment  ( X-Men ), and Marvel Films Animation ( Spider-Man ), each produced a Marvel series for television. [15]   Tom Tataranowicz  was in charge of both Marvel Films Animation and New World Animation during this period. [16] \n \n News Corporation subsidiary (1996) [ edit ] \n News Corporation/Fox Entertainment Group acquired New World Entertainment, along with New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation, in August 1996. [17]  At the same time, Saban Entertainment secured the rights from Marvel Entertainment Group for Captain America, Daredevil and Silver Surfer and additional characters to be developed into four series and 52 episodes over the next seven years. [18] \n Fox Children's Productions and Saban Entertainment both merged to form  Fox Kids Worldwide , a holding company and joint venture, in November 1996, [19]  while Fox retained ownership of New World Animation. [20]  \n \n Postscript [ edit ] \n Fox Family Worldwide and its assets, including the Marvel Productions library and Saban Entertainment, were purchased by the Walt Disney Company for $5.2 billion in July 2001, [21] [22] [23]  with Saban Entertainment renamed to  BVS Entertainment  in October 2001. [24] \n After getting its 2002 profit participation statements for the Marvel Productions library, Marvel Enterprises sued The Walt Disney Company over royalties in August 2004 after Disney would not open their books. This was followed by a November 2004 suit which claimed that the purchase of Fox Family did not transfer the shows' copyrights to Disney as the purchase was done without Marvel's approval. As part of both suits, Marvel claimed library income concealment and failure to exploit the characters. [21] \n On August 31, 2009, Disney acquired Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion, reunifying the Marvel Productions library and Marvel Entertainment under the same corporate banner.

The company is a wholly owned  subsidiary  of  The Walt Disney Company , and is mainly known for its  Marvel Comics .\n In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment for  US$4 billion ; [2]  it has been a  limited liability company  (LLC) since then. For financial reporting purposes, Marvel is primarily reported as part of Disney's  Consumer Products  segment ever since  Marvel Studios ' reorganization from Marvel Entertainment into  Walt Disney Studios . [3] \n Over the years, Marvel Entertainment has entered into several partnerships and negotiations with other companies across a variety of businesses. As of 2019 [update] , Marvel has film licensing agreements with  Sony Pictures  (for  Spider-Man films ) and  Universal Pictures  (a  right of first refusal  to pick up the distribution rights to any  future Hulk films  produced by Marvel Studios), and theme park licensing agreements with  IMG Worlds of Adventure  and  Universal Parks & Resorts  (for specific Marvel character rights at  Islands of Adventure  and  Universal Studios Japan ).

(Marvel or MEG), incorporated on  December 2, 1986 , [6]  and included  Marvel Comics  and  Marvel Productions . That year, it was sold to New World Entertainment Ltd as part of the liquidation of  Cadence Industries . [8]  On January 6, 1989,  Ronald Perelman 's  MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings  bought Marvel Entertainment Group from New World for $82.5 million. [9]  The deal did not include  Marvel Productions , which was folded into New World's TV and movie business. [8] \n \"It is a mini-Disney in terms of intellectual property,\" said Perelman. \"Disney's got much more highly recognized characters and softer characters, whereas our characters are termed action heroes. But at Marvel we are now in the business of the creation and marketing of characters.\" [1] \n \n Public offering and acquisition [ edit ] \n Marvel made an  initial public offering  of 40% of the stock (ticker symbol NYSE:MRV) on July 15, 1991, giving $40 million from the proceeds to Andrews Group, Marvel's then direct parent corporation within MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. [9] [10] \n In the early 1990s, Marvel Entertainment Group began expanding though acquisitions and the formation of new divisions. Marvel purchased the  trading card  company  Fleer  on July 24, 1992. [9]  On April 30, 1993, Marvel acquired 46% of  ToyBiz , which gave the company the rights to make Marvel toys. [9]  The Andrews Group named  Avi Arad  of ToyBiz as the president and CEO of the  Marvel Films  division. [11] \n In 1993 and 1994, Marvel's  holding companies , Marvel Holdings, Inc. and Marvel Parent Holdings, Inc., were formed between Andrews Group and MEG. The companies issued over half a billion dollars in bonds under the direction of Perelman, which was passed up in dividends to Perlman's group of companies. [12]  Marvel acquired  Panini Group , an Italian sticker-maker, and  Heroes World Distribution , a regional distributor to comic-book shops, in 1994. It acquired trading card company  SkyBox International  in 1995. [9] \n Marvel's attempt to distribute its products directly led to a decrease in sales and aggravated the losses which Marvel suffered when the  comic book bubble [13] [ citation needed ]  popped, the  1994 Major League Baseball strike  massacred the profits of the Fleer unit, [14]  and Panini, whose revenue depended largely on Disney licensing, was hobbled by poor Disney showings at the box office. [15] \n \n Bankruptcy and Marvel Studios [ edit ] \n In late 1995, Marvel reported its first annual loss under Perelman, which was attributed mainly to the company's large size and a shrinking market.  [9]  On January 4, 1996 Marvel laid off 275 employees. [16] \n In late 1996, Perelman proposed a plan to save Marvel in which the company would merge with Toy Biz after Perelman spent $350 million for the Toy Biz shares that he didn't already own. He would then receive newly issued Marvel shares to maintain his 80 percent stake. [9]  \n Separately, in July 1996, Marvel filed with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  to raise money to create a private entity called  Marvel Studios . [17]  Much of the money to create Marvel Studios came from the sale of  Toy Biz  stock. [17] [18] \n In December 1996, the Marvel group of companies filed for bankruptcy. [1] [9]  At this time,  Carl Icahn , an American businessman and investor, began buying Marvel's bonds at 20% of their value and moved to block Perelman's plan. [9]  In February 1997, Icahn won the bankruptcy court's approval to take control of the company's stock. [9]  Later, in June 1997, Icahn won the right to replace Marvel's board, including Perelman. [9]  \n In December 1997, during the post-bankruptcy reorganization phase, Toy Biz came to an agreement to purchase Marvel from the banks. [1] [9]  In December 1997, the bankruptcy court appointed a trustee to oversee the company in place of Ichan. [9]  In April 1998, while the legal battle continued, the NYSE delisted Marvel stock. [9]  \n In August 2008, former company head Ronald Perelman paid $80 million to settle a lawsuit accusing him of helping divert $553.5 million in notes when he controlled the company. [12] \n \n Marvel Enterprises [ edit ] \n ToyBiz and Marvel Entertainment Group were merged into Marvel Enterprises to bring it out of bankruptcy in June 1998. [1]  In February 1999, Fleer/Skybox was sold to a corporation owned by  Alex  and Roger Grass, a father and son, for US$30 million. [19] \n Later, the rights to names like \"Spider-Man\" were being challenged. Toy Biz hired an attorney to review its license agreement. Los Angeles patent attorney  Carole E. Handler  found a legal loophole in the licensing of the Marvel name and was successful in reclaiming Marvel Enterprises' movie rights to its character Spider-Man. [20] [21] [22] \n Marvel Enterprise organized itself into four major units, Marvel Studios, Toy Biz, Licensing and Publishing, while in November 1999 adding Marvel Characters Group to manage Marvel's IP and oversee marketing. [23]  Marvel named its Marvel New Media president, Steve Milo, in November 2000 to oversee its website. [24] \n In 2003, Bill Stine purchased back  Quest Aerospace , a 1995 Toy Biz acquisition, from Marvel. [25]  In summer 2003, Marvel placed an offer for  Artisan Entertainment . [26]  A new unit, Marvel International, was set up in London under a president, Bruno Maglione, to extend the company's operation and presence in major overseas markets in November 2003. [27]  In December 2003, Marvel Entertainment acquired Cover Concepts from  Hearst Communications, Inc. [28]  In November 2004, Marvel consolidated its children's sleepwear-apparel licensing business with American Marketing Enterprises, Inc. [29] \n In November 2004, the corporation sued  South Korea -based NCSoft Corp. and  San Jose, California -based Cryptic Studios Inc. over possible trademark infringement in their  City of Heroes  massive multiplayer online game. [30]  Marvel settled a film-royalties lawsuit in April 2005 with its former editor-in-chief, publisher and creator,  Stan Lee , paying him $10 million and negotiating an end to his royalties. [31] \n \n Marvel Entertainment [ edit ] \n In September 2005, Marvel Enterprises changed its name to Marvel Entertainment to reflect the corporation's expansion into financing  its own movie slate . [32] [33] \n In 2007, several  Stan Lee Media  related groups filed lawsuits against Marvel Entertainment for $1 billion and for Lee's Marvel creations in multiple states, most of which have been dismissed. [34]  Additionally, a lawsuit over ownership of the character  Ghost Rider  was filed on March 30, 2007, by  Gary Friedrich  and Gary Friedrich Enterprises, Inc. [35] \n \n Disney subsidiary (2009\u2013present) [ edit ] \n On August 31, 2009,  The Walt Disney Company  announced a deal to acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4.24 billion, with Marvel  shareholders  to receive $30 and approximately 0.745 Disney shares for each share of Marvel they own. [36]  The voting occurred on December 31, 2009 and the merger was approved. [2] [37]  The acquisition of Marvel was finalized hours after the shareholder vote, therefore giving Disney full ownership of Marvel Entertainment. [38]  The company was  delisted  from the  New York Stock Exchange  under its ticker symbol (MVL), due to the closing of the deal.\n On June 2, 2010 Marvel announced that it promoted  Joe Quesada  to Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment. [39]  In June 2010, Marvel set up a  television division  headed by  Jeph Loeb  as executive vice president. [40]  Three months later,  Smith & Tinker  licensed from Marvel the character rights for a  superhero  digital collectible game for Facebook and Apple's mobile platform. [41]  On October 1, 2010, Marvel moved its offices to a 60,000-square-foot (5,600\u00a0m 2 ) suite at 135 W. 50th Street, New York City, New York, under a nine-year sublease contract. [42] \n Stan Lee Media 's lawsuit against Marvel was dismissed again in February 2011. [34] [43] \n In March 2013,  Feld Entertainment  agreed with Marvel to produce a  Marvel Character-based live arena show . Marvel was also launching a new pop culture and lifestyle web show, \u201cEarth\u2019s Mightiest Show\u201d. [44]  On August 22, 2013, Marvel Entertainment announced that it was working with  Hero Ventures  on The  Marvel Experience , a traveling production/attraction. [45]  In April 2014,  Hong Kong Disneyland  announced the construction of  Iron Man Experience , the first Marvel ride at any Disney theme park. It opened in 2017 and was built on a location in the park's  Tomorrowland . [46] \n On September 16, 2009, [47]  the  Jack Kirby  estate served notices of termination to  Walt Disney Studios ,  20th Century Fox ,  Universal Pictures ,  Paramount Pictures , and  Sony Pictures  to attempt to gain control of various Silver Age Marvel characters. [48] [49]  Marvel sought to invalidate those claims. [50] [51]  In mid-March 2010 Kirby's estate \"sued Marvel to terminate copyrights and gain profits from [Kirby's] comic creations.\" [52]  In July 2011, the  United States District Court for the Southern District of New York  issued a  summary judgment  in favor of Marvel, [47] [53]  which was affirmed in August 2013 by the  United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit . [54]  The Kirby estate filed a petition on March 21, 2014 for a review of the case by the  Supreme Court of the United States , [55] [56]  but a settlement was reached on September 26, 2014 and the family requested that the petition be dismissed. [57] \n Marvel president of TV, publishing and brand  Dan Buckley  was promoted to Marvel Entertainment president in January 2017 adding games, global brand management and the franchise groups to his current responsibilities. [58]  In October 2017, Ron Richards began working at Marvel Entertainment as Vice President and Managing Editor of New Media. [59]  Marvel New Media expanded into a new field with the development of a scripted podcast series,  Wolverine: The Long Night , announced on December 5, 2017. [60] \n On December 7, 2017, Marvel announced its  Marvel Rising  franchise focusing on new characters as youngsters starting with animation in 2018. Marvel Comics is expected to publish material for Marvel Rising, but delayed any announcement on their material. [61] \n In May 2018, The Walt Disney Company Australia purchased eight year naming rights to  Docklands Stadium  from Melbourne Stadiums Limited and selected the Marvel brand as part of the name. Since September 1, 2018, the stadium has been known commercially as Marvel Stadium. A Marvel retail store and other inclusion of Marvel would be added to the stadium. [62] \n In October 2019,  Marvel Studios ' Kevin Feige was named Marvel Chief Creative Officer, overseeing all the creative affairs within Marvel Entertainment in addition to Marvel Studios.

For for the company itself, see  Marvel Entertainment . \n Toy Biz The last logo utilized by Marvel Toys under the Toy Biz brand Trade name Marvel Toys Formerly Charan Toys Former type Subsidiary Industry Toys Fate Defunct Founded 1988 in  Montreal ,  Quebec ,  Canada Founder Charan Industries Defunct 2007 Headquarters New York City ,  New York ,  United States Products Games, toys and children's vehicles; dolls and stuffed toys Owner Isaac Perlmutter Avi Arad Parent Marvel Entertainment \n Toy Biz  (formerly stylized as  ToyBiz  and later re-branded to  Marvel Toys ) was an American toy company which later became a subsidiary of  Marvel Enterprises/Entertainment . It was best known for producing  action figures ,  stuffed toys , and  role-playing games  of various licensed brands and characters.\n The company originated in  Montreal ,  Quebec , as Charan Toys. In 1988, Charan Toys was renamed to ToyBiz and became an American firm. In 1990, it obtained the master toy license for the  Marvel Entertainment Group , and by 1993 became partially owned by Marvel. [1]  In 1998, ToyBiz merged with Marvel Entertainment Group to bring it out of bankruptcy, with the two companies merging and creating  Marvel Enterprises . Whilst the original 'ToyBiz' was absorbed into Marvel Enterprises, Marvel Enterprises called its main toy subsidiary 'Toy Biz' (with the space in-between the two words); as consumers were familiar with the Toy Biz brand. In 2005, Marvel Enterprises was renamed to Marvel Entertainment to reflect the  Marvel Cinematic Universe , in addition to this, Toy Biz replaced its name with 'Marvel Toys' on some of its non-Marvel figure lines to reflect the universe name change. The subsidiary would then become 'Marvel Toys' outright by the end of 2006. \n Due to Marvel Entertainment's bankruptcy, the company became financially unable to continue to run the Marvel Toys subsidiary at its current level, and  Hasbro  purchased the master toy license for Marvel Entertainment characters, releasing its first products in January 2007. Marvel Toys attempted to survive with non-Marvel owned characters throughout 2007, though still faced financial problems. The website for Marvel Toys became inactive in late 2007.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   History \n \n 1.1   Late 19th century to 1997 \n \n 1.1.1   Charan Toys (Canadian company) \n 1.1.2   Toy Biz (American company) \n \n \n 1.2   1998 to 2007 \n \n 1.2.1   Toy Biz as a subsidiary \n 1.2.2   Marvel Entertainment licensing agreement to Hasbro \n \n \n \n \n 2   See also \n 3   References \n 4   External links \n \n \n\n History \n Late 19th century to 1997 \n Charan Toys (Canadian company) \n The company's original forerunner was a Canadian company, Chantex, Inc., which started in the late 19th century. Started by the Zuckerman family, the business grew from $.16 million in sales to sales of $4.5 million in 1980. [1]  In 1980, Chantex merged with Earl Takefman's Randim Marketing, Inc., a school supply manufacturer and wholesaler to become Charan Industries Inc. [ citation needed ]  Its Charan Toy, Inc. subsidiary became a leading licensing toy company in 1985. [1]  In addition to toys, Charan used a very broad approach to implementing its brands across all lines, including acquiring a hockey equipment brand in the mid-1980s. [2]  \n \n Toy Biz (American company) \n In 1990, Charan, including the Toy Biz subsidiary, was purchased by businessman Ike Perlmutter. [3]  In 1993, Toy Biz made a deal for \"exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free licenses\" of  Marvel Characters  for 46 percent of Toy Biz equity. [4]   Avi Arad , a toy designer and comic book fan joined Toy Biz that same year. [3]   \n Toy Biz continued licensing outside brands, including  Hercules: The Legendary Journeys  and  Xena: Warrior Princess  action figures based on the  Action Pack  television series shown on many  New World  television stations. Also, agreements with  Gerber [5]  and  NASCAR  were acquired. [ citation needed ] [1]  In 1995, Toy Biz acquired  Spectra Star , Inc. [6]  and  Quest Aerospace  Education, Inc., both toy companies. [1]  Toy Biz started up its Classic Heroes candy division in 1996, which sold candy/toy combinations using mainly Marvel characters. [ citation needed ]  The company also entered the electronic learning aids (ELA) segment of the toy industry in 1996 with a licensing agreement with  Apple Computer . [1]  \n Toy Biz partially acquired Marvel Entertainment Group. [7]  In the late 1990s, Marvel Entertainment Group filed for bankruptcy and became the subject of a battle for control in bankruptcy court. [8] [9]  The company was salvaged in 1997 and merged with Toy Biz in 1998. [10] [7]  The new company became  Marvel Enterprises , and Toy Biz became a division of the new company. [11] [4]   \n \n    Toy Biz and Marvel Entertainment Group merged to form  Marvel Enterprises . This entity became the holdings company for Marvel assets. \n 1998 to 2007 \n Toy Biz as a subsidiary \n In 1999, Toy Biz ventured into  professional wrestling . Toy Biz to acquired the master toy license of  World Championship Wrestling  (WCW). After two years, the license deal was cut short, due to WCW being purchased by the World Wrestling Federation/WWF (Now World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE) in 2001. [ citation needed ]  The company also licensed products for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. [ citation needed ]  \n In 2001, Marvel Enterprises licensed the rights to the 'Toy Biz' name to a Hong Kong-based toy manufacturer, Toy Biz Worldwide Ltd. Toy Biz also outsourced much of the manufacturing to Toy Biz Worldwide. [12]  The deal was ended abruptly in 2006. [13] [14] \n In September 2005, Marvel Enterprises changed its name to Marvel Entertainment to reflect the corporation's expansion into creating the  Marvel Cinematic Universe . As a result of this change, Toy Biz would replace some branding of its figure lines, and replace it with a 'Marvel Toys' logo instead. This only applied to non-Marvel Comics products, as Marvel Comics characters would still continue to use the Toy Biz branding. [ citation needed ] \n \n Marvel Entertainment licensing agreement to Hasbro \n In January 2006, Marvel Entertainment signed a five-year licensing agreement with  Hasbro Inc.  for $205 million, giving Hasbro the right to make toys and games based on Marvel Comic licenses. As a result of this, Marvel Entertainment prematurely terminated its agreement with Toy Biz Worldwide Ltd, by a year. [14]  As a result of the early termination, Marvel Entertainment paid Toy Biz Worldwide a penalty of between $13-16 million USD. Marvel Entertainment officially stopped using the \"Toy Biz\" branding and name from 1 January 2007, and the division was rebranded as Marvel Toys. [ citation needed ] \n Throughout 2007, the division struggled to stay afloat without the Marvel Comic characters. The company introduced a series called the Legendary Comic Book Heroes \u2013 making action figures of non-Marvel Comic characters, though it suffered with poor sales. The company also furthered its TNA Wrestling, Code Lyoko and Curious George lines. Marvel Entertainment quietly began to close the division. In late 2007, the company's website shut down.

Renamed Trans Tech Bus, the new company introduced three different models of school buses.  Single and Dual Rear Wheel models were based on Ford and GM van chassis, while the Medium-Duty model was built on a GM medium-duty truck chassis.  The Medium-Duty bus was discontinued after 2009 following the end of General Motors production of the C4500/5500 chassis.\n For 2012, the Trans Tech model line saw a complete redesign.  The new ST Aero, SST, and Roadstar feature a redesigned bodyshell with a focus on aerodynamics.  The CST (Child-Safe Transporter) is a version of the SST available for MFSAB (Multi-Function School Activity Bus) use.\nA new bus on  Ford Transit  chassis was introduced. and is set to begin production in April 2017 named \"Trans Star\" with up to 20 passengers.\n \n Products [ edit ] \n    Trans Tech Dual Rear Wheel on Ford E-450 chassis \n 2012\u2013present \n \n\n \n Model Name\n \n ST Aero\n \n SST\n \n Roadstar\n \n eTrans [2] \n \n \n Available Versions\n \n \n School Bus\n \n \n \n School Bus MFSAB (CST) \n \n \n School Bus\n \n \n \n School Bus\n \n \n \n Configuration\n \n Type A\n \n Type A\n \n Type A\n \n Type A-2\n \n \n Chassis Provider\n \n \n General Motors \n \n Chevrolet Express GMC Savana \n \n \n Ford Motor Company \n \n E-350 E-450 \n General Motors \n \n Chevrolet Express GMC Savana \n \n Motiv Power Systems \n [1] \n \n \n Notes\n \n Single rear-wheel Type A school bus\n \n Standard dual rear-wheel Type A bus MFSAB model sold as CST (Child-Safe Transporter) \n \n Narrow-body dual-wheel Type A school bus\n \n Battery-powered fully electric school bus.\n \n 2007-2011 \n \n\n \n Model Name\n \n Single Rear Wheel [3] \n \n Dual Rear Wheel [4] [5] \n \n Medium-Duty\n \n \n Available Versions\n \n \n School Bus \n Commercial Bus \n MFSAB (activity bus) \n \n \n School Bus \n Commercial Bus \n MFSAB (activity bus) \n \n \n School Bus \n Commercial Bus \n MFSAB (activity bus) \n \n \n Configuration\n \n Type A\n \n Type A\n \n Type A-2\n \n \n Maximum Seating Capacity\n \n \n \n \n 34 (Ford) \n 30 (GM) \n \n 42 [6] \n \n \n Chassis Provider\n \n Ford Motor Company \n Ford  E-350 \n General Motors \n \n Chevrolet  Express \n GMC  Savana \n \n \n Ford Motor Company \n \n Ford  E-350 \n Ford  E-450 \n General Motors \n \n Chevrolet  Express \n GMC  Savana \n \n General Motors \n Chevrolet/GMC C4500/5500 \n \n TransTech Bus prides itself on its progressive flexible manufacturing facility which allow a wide variety of options, TransTech Buses may include;\n \n Flat-Floor Configurations Wheelchair Lifts (Ricon, Braun, etc.) Track Seating (L-Track or Slide-Track) Air Conditioning (Bus-Air, MCC, ACT, etc.) Acoustic Ceilings Child Check Systems Camera Installations Electric Bi-fold Doors (Including Street-side Bi-fold mounting) Complete LED lighting options Vandal Lock Systems \n e-Trans [ edit ] \n In October 2011, at the yearly conference of the National Association of Pupil Transportation, Trans Tech debuted the first factory-built battery-powered electric school bus. [2]   A 42-passenger vehicle based on the  Newton electric truck  from Smith Electric Vehicles.  With the chassis manufactured in the Bronx, New York City, the entire bus was manufactured in New York State. A set of two Lithium-ion batteries give the eTrans an approximate range of up to 130 miles between charges, taking an average of eight hours to fully recharge. [2]  This initial vehicle was never certified to operate, and the grant project  [7]  was later taken over by  Motiv Power Systems .

Website marvel .com /tv \n Marvel Television  is a division of  Marvel Studios , responsible for live-action and animated (through  Marvel Animation ) television shows and direct-to-DVD series. [2] [3]  The division is based at affiliate  ABC Studios ' location. [1]   Marvel Television has also collaborated with  20th Century Fox  in producing shows based on the  X-Men  franchise such as  Legion  and  The Gifted .

The Incredible Hulk  (1978\u20131982), produced by  Universal Television  and aired on  CBS , was Marvel's only successful live action television series, running five seasons. The last TV series,  Blade: The Series , produced by  New Line Television  (now ceased and folded into  Warner Bros. Television ), was canceled after one season on  Spike . [7] [8] \n Marvel's first live action TV licenses were for Spider-Man with the character in  The Electric Company 's  Spidey Super Stories  segments (1974\u20131977), CBS's  The Amazing Spider-Man  series (1977\u20131979) and  Toei 's  tokusatsu  style  Spider-Man  series (1978\u20131979).  The Amazing Spider-Man  pulled in reasonable ratings but was canceled in 1979 by CBS as they did not want to be known as the \"comic book\" network as they had already had three comic book-based shows, choosing to stay with  The Incredible Hulk , as it had the better ratings. [9] \n In 1978,  Doctor Strange  received  a television film  to act as a  pilot  similarly to  Spider-Man  and  Hulk .  Captain America  also starred in two pilots in 1979,  Captain America  and  Captain America II: Death Too Soon . None of these pilots were picked up. [9] \n After the end of  The Incredible Hulk  in 1982, live action Marvel shows did not return until 1988 with  The Incredible Hulk Returns , designed as a backdoor pilot for  Thor . Additionally,  The Trial of the Incredible Hulk  acted as a backdoor pilot for  Daredevil , and  The Death of the Incredible Hulk  premiered in 1990. [9] \n Three direct pilots were done in the 1990s,  Power Pack ,  Generation X  and  Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. , but none of them were picked up for series. Marvel had better luck in  syndicating  their properties in the late 1990s and early 2000s with  Night Man  and  Mutant X , lasting two and three seasons, respectively. The latter show triggered a lawsuit by  20th Century Fox , who held the film rights for the  X-Men . As a follow up to the  Blade  film series ,  Blade: The Series  was created for cable TV, lasting one season in 2006. [9] \n \n History [ edit ] \n Entertainment division [ edit ] \n On June 28, 2010,  Marvel Entertainment  announced the start of Marvel Television, together with the appointment of  Jeph Loeb  to head up the division as executive vice president, head of television. [2] [10]  In October 2010, it was announced that the first live-action television series from Marvel Television for  ABC  would be centered on the  Hulk , [11]  developed by  Guillermo del Toro . [12]  In December 2010, it was revealed that  Melissa Rosenberg  was developing  AKA Jessica Jones , based on the comic book series  Alias  and centered on  Jessica Jones , for ABC, intended to air in 2011 of the  2011\u20132012 television season . [13] \n At  San Diego Comic-Con International  2011, Loeb revealed, in addition to the Hulk project and  AKA Jessica Jones , Marvel Television also had  Cloak and Dagger  and  Mockingbird  in development at  ABC Family . [14]  In October 2011,  ABC Studios  sold a Punisher script to  Fox , who gave the project a  put-pilot  commitment. [15]  In April 2012, Marvel Television signed with  Creative Artists Agency  for live action representation. [1]  In May 2012, it was announced that the Hulk project was not ready for the 2012\u20132013 season, and would possibly be for the 2013\u20132014 season. It was also announced that ABC had passed on  AKA Jessica Jones . [16] \n In July 2012, it was reported that Marvel had again entered into discussions with ABC to create a show set in the  Marvel Cinematic Universe , [17]  and in August 2012, ABC ordered a pilot to be written by  Joss Whedon ,  Jed Whedon , and  Maurissa Tancharoen , and directed by Joss Whedon, [18]  that became  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. [19]  It was officially ordered to series on May 10, 2013. [20]  By September 2013, Marvel was developing a series inspired by the  Agent Carter   Marvel One-Shot , featuring  Peggy Carter , with  Deadline  reporting it was one of several series in development at Marvel. [21] \n By October 2013, Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to  video on demand  services and cable providers, with  Netflix ,  Amazon , and  WGN America  expressing interest. [22]  In November 2013, it was announced that Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series starting in 2015, based on  Daredevil ,  Jessica Jones ,  Iron Fist , and  Luke Cage , leading up to a miniseries based on the  Defenders . [23] [24]  Responding to the Netflix announcement, Disney CEO  Bob Iger  said that Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones may appear on film if their shows are successful and that another outlet was chosen as ABC and Disney XD could not handle all Marvel shows. [12]  Disney will spend approximately $200 million in financing for the series. [25]  The four Netflix shows are set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. [26] \n It was also revealed in November 2013 that the Hulk project first announced in 2012 had been shelved, with Loeb saying, when \"we saw what Joss Whedon and  Mark Ruffalo  were creating in  The Avengers , that was a better solution.\" [12]  On May 8, 2014, ABC officially renewed  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  for a second season and ordered  Marvel's Agent Carter  straight to series, [27]  which later aired in January 2015.\n In early April 2015, two unspecified shows were said to be in development to air on ABC: one was a  spin-off series  of  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  centered on  Bobbi Morse  ( Adrianne Palicki ) and  Lance Hunter  ( Nick Blood ), which was being developed by Bell and writer  Paul Zbyszewski  based off storylines occurring at the end of the second season, and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot; [28] [29]  and another with writer-producer  John Ridley . [30]  On May 7, 2015, ABC renewed  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  and  Agent Carter  for a third and second season, respectively. [31]  Additionally, ABC also passed on the  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  spinoff, [32]  though ABC Entertainment president  Paul Lee  did not rule out returning to the spin-off in the future, and Lee also confirmed that Ridley was working on a Marvel property for ABC. [33]  Also in May, Iger indicated that Disney saw potential in creating a streaming service dedicated to Marvel content as a way to further \"take product... directly to consumer\". [34] \n In August 2015, the  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  spin-off series received new life as a reworked series, titled  Marvel's Most Wanted , with a pilot order. Bell and Zbyszewski once again developed the series, while also serving as co-writers of the pilot, executive producers, and showrunners, with Loeb also attached as executive producer. [35]  The series would still focus on Morse and Hunter, with Palicki and Blood both attached, but is no longer intended to be a true spin-off of  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  as previously believed, instead \"being described as a new take focusing on the same duo and their continuing adventures.\" [36] \n At the end of August 2015, Marvel Entertainment's film subsidiary  Marvel Studios  was integrated into  The Walt Disney Studios , leaving Marvel Television and Marvel Animation (formerly part of Marvel Studios) under Marvel Entertainment and CEO  Isaac Perlmutter 's control. [37] \n In October 2015, ABC ordered a  put pilot  for a half-hour live action comedy series  Damage Control , based on the comics construction company of  the same name . The series is being developed by  Ben Karlin . [38]  Later in the month,  FX  ordered a pilot for  Legion , about  David Haller , a young man who may be more than human. The pilot was produced by FX Productions (FXP) and Marvel Television, with FXP handling the physical production. Also in October,  Fox Broadcasting Company  announced that  20th Century Fox Television  and Marvel Television were developing a series titled  Hellfire Club , based on the secret society from the comics of  the same name . [4] [5] \n In January 2016, Lee stated the  Most Wanted  pilot would begin production \"in the next few months\" and announced that a second Marvel comedy series was in development in addition to  Damage Control . [39] [40]  Also in January, Netflix was in the early stages of developing a  Punisher  television series starring  Jon Bernthal , who appeared in the second season of  Daredevil . [41]  More information was revealed regarding the  Legion  series, including that in addition to the pilot, FX had ordered several scripts and that it would not take place in the established  X-Men  film universe but in a parallel universe instead. Should the series be picked up, it would consist of 10 episodes and is expected to air in 2016. [42] \n In April 2016, the ABC-owned network  Freeform  greenlit  Cloak & Dagger  with a straight-to-series order as Marvel's first work with  ABC Signature . [43]  The series, which is set in the MCU, [44]  premiered in 2018. [45]  At the end of the month, Marvel and Netflix officially picked up the series,  The Punisher , with Bernthal attached to reprise his role as the lead character. [46]  In May 2016, ABC cancelled  Agent Carter  and passed on the pilot for  Most Wanted . [47] [48] \n In July 2016, Fox and Marvel announced a put pilot order for an untitled series developed by  Matt Nix . The series, which will be produced by 20th Century Fox and Marvel, with 20th Century Fox handling physical production, focuses on two ordinary parents who discover their children possess mutant powers, forcing them to run from the government and join an underground network of mutants. Nix will serve as an executive producer along with  Bryan Singer ,  Lauren Shuler Donner ,  Simon Kinberg , Loeb and Jim Chory. It was also revealed that  Hellfire Club  was no longer in development. [49] \n The following month, it was announced that  Runaways  had received a pilot order, along with additional scripts, from the streaming service  Hulu , based on the team  of the same name . The pilot is written by  Josh Schwartz  and  Stephanie Savage , who also serve as executive producers and showrunners. [50]  By the end of the month, the division and ABC Studios were developing a half-hour comedy series based on the  New Warriors  featuring  Squirrel Girl , with the series being offered to cable networks and streaming outlets. [51]  In April 2017, Freeform announced a straight-to-series order for the half-hour live action series,  Marvel's New Warriors , with the first season, consisting of 10 episodes, set to air in 2018. [52]  In May 2017, Hulu ordered  Runaways  to series with 10 episodes, [53]  to premiere on November 21, 2017. [54] \n In November 2016, Marvel Television and  IMAX Corporation  announced  Inhumans , [55] [56]  to be produced in conjunction with ABC Studios, and to air on ABC. The series, which is co-financed by IMAX and saw the first two episodes and select subsequent action sequences filmed with  IMAX  digital cameras, [55] [57]  had versions of the first two episodes be screened in IMAX beginning September 1, 2017, for two weeks, before premiering on ABC on September 29. [58] \n In May 2017, Fox ordered the Matt Nix TV series, now titled  The Gifted , to series, [6]  and  FXX  placed a series order for an adult animated series based on  Deadpool , which will be co-produced by Marvel Television, FX Productions and ABC Signature Studios.  Donald Glover  and his brother  Stephen Glover  would serve as showrunners, executive producers and writers for the series. [59]  In August 2017, senior vice president of original programming Karim Zreik indicated that Marvel Television was working with ABC on a \" Jessica Jones -esque\" female-focused show. [60]  By November 2017, Disney was developing a Marvel series specifically for release on its new  Disney+  streaming service, which it planned to launch before the end of 2019. [61]  By March 2018, the Deadpool series was no longer in development. [62]  In May 2018, ABC cancelled  Inhumans  after one season. [63]  By September,  Allan Heinberg  began developing a Marvel series for ABC about female superheroes. [64] \n In October 2018, Netflix cancelled both  Iron Fist  and  Luke Cage , each after two seasons, [65] [66]  followed by the cancellation of  Daredevil  in November after three seasons.  Luke Cage  was cancelled do to third season financial terms, while  Daredevil  was due to Netflix looking to fund their own properties. [67]  Kevin Mayer, chairman of Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International, indicated that he would consider the show for Disney+, [68]  but the Netflix-Marvel TV pack restricts the appearance of the four original characters from any non-Netflix series for two years after being canceled. Thus 2020 would be the earliest that the shows could be revived on Disney+. [69] \n In February 2019, it was announced that  Legion  would end after its third season. [70]  It was also revealed that Heinberg's series would not move forward at ABC. [71]  In addition, Hulu ordered four adult animated Marvel series leading up to a crossover special titled  The Offenders , all to be executive produced by Loeb. [72]  Hulu also expressed interest in reviving the cancelled Netflix series. [73]  Netflix then cancelled both  Jessica Jones  and  The Punisher . [74] \n \n Studios division [ edit ] \n In October 2019, Marvel Studios President  Kevin Feige  was given the title of Chief Creative Officer, Marvel, and will oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television and Marvel Family Entertainment (animation), with both being placed under the Marvel Studios banner. [75]  With the promotion of Feige, Loeb is expected to leave his post as the head of Marvel Television by Thanksgiving.

For the Marvel Studios record label, see  Marvel Studios \u00a7\u00a0Marvel Music . \n Marvel Music Parent company Marvel Comics Status Discontinued (1995) Founded 1994 \u00a0( 1994 ) Country of origin United States Headquarters location New York City Key people Mort Todd (Editor) Karl Bollers (assistant editor) [1] Publication types Comics Fiction genres Music \n Marvel Music  was a short-lived  imprint  of  Marvel Comics , introduced in 1994 to publish comics developed in collaboration with musicians. \n The concept descended from previous Marvel collaborations with  Kiss  (which starred in a  Marvel Comics Super Special  featuring the band portrayed as superheroes fighting Marvel villains), and  Alice Cooper . In an effort to diversify beyond superhero works, Marvel introduced the Marvel Music imprint in 1994, with  Mort Todd  as its editor. The imprint featured comics influenced by the life stories and music of various musicians and bands, having published works in collaboration with Alice Cooper,  Billy Ray Cyrus , the estate of  Bob Marley ,  Marty Stuart ,  Onyx , and the  Rolling Stones .\n The Marvel Music series was considered unsuccessful; Todd felt that Marvel did not market the series well, while only Marty Stuart took up Marvel's suggestion to sell the comics as concert merchandise. Marvel's president Terry Stewart felt that the imprint may have been \"doomed at the beginning\", and it was discontinued in 1995 in the wake of Marvel's descent into bankruptcy.\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Background \n 2   History \n 3   Titles \n 4   References \n 5   External links \n \n \n\n Background [ edit ] \n Marvel had previously published some music-based comics; the premiere issue of  Marvel Comics Super Special , dated simply 1977, featured the rock band  Kiss  in a 40-page  fictional adventure  written by  Steve Gerber ,  penciled  by  John Romita Jr. ,  Alan Weiss ,  John Buscema ,  Rich Buckler , and  Sal Buscema , which saw the quartet battling Marvel  supervillains   Mephisto  and  Doctor Doom . [2]  Issue 50 of  Marvel Premiere  (stand date of October 1979) featured a story,  Tales From the Inside , featuring  Alice Cooper . [1] [3] \n \n History [ edit ] \n In 1991,  Neil Gaiman  was approached by an  Epic Records  executive, seeking help in developing a  concept album  for Alice Cooper. Gaiman was interested in the project, having been familiar with Cooper, telling  Spin  that \"when I was a kid 15 years earlier than that, I had read  Marvel Premiere  #50,  Alice Cooper: Tales From the Inside , and I also loved  Welcome to My Nightmare . My cousins were the Alice Cooper fans; I was the  David Bowie ,  Lou Reed  fan. But they had made me watch ' Teenage Lament '74 ' on  Top of the Pops .\" [1] \n Marvel president Terry Stewart was seeking to diversify Marvel's output beyond superhero comics; noticing the popularity of  Revolutionary Comics '  Rock 'N' Roll Comics  series, which featured unauthorized biographies of bands, Stewart felt that there was a market for comics based on musicians. [1] [3]   Marvel published  Cheap Trick : Busted  and  Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E : Coming to Yaa  as test runs in 1990. Stewart enlisted  Mort Todd  to serve as an editor for a music-focused imprint. The concept was met with some skepticism internally; assistant editor Karl Bollers recalled that \"[when the] superhero heads in the office heard that we were doing rock comics, there was a feeling of, 'Oh my god, this is terrible!'\", showing concerns that the idea would either be too kitschy, or follow in the footsteps of Revolutionary, which had been sued twice by musicians over their portrayals in  Rock 'N' Roll Comics . [1] [3]  \n In contrast to  Rock 'N' Roll Comics , Marvel planned to grant creative control over its music comics to their respective musicians;  Onyx  worked directly with Bollers (who was a fan of their debut album  Bacdafucup ) to develop  Onyx: Fight! , a post-apocalyptic story which was written as a tie-in to their sophomore album  All We Got Iz Us . Group member  Sticky Fingaz  was supportive of their collaboration, as he was a fan of Marvel Comics himself. [1] [3]  Alice Cooper's collaboration with Gaiman, \" The Last Temptation \", was adapted into a comic and released under the imprint in June 1994. [1] [3]   KRS-One  collaborated on  Break the Chain , which was bundled with an audio cassette featuring his music. [4]  Another entry in the series,  Tale Of The Tuff Gong , was a biographical story based on the life of  Bob Marley . [4] \n The titles were hampered by poor promotion. [1]   Todd felt that Marvel \"didn't know how to sell anything that wasn't superheroes\", recalling that \"I was talking with their marketing people, and they were like, 'You know, we just can't really sell  Elvis  or Bob Marley.' And I was like, 'What? There are companies that sell Elvis tampons, and you can't sell an Elvis comic book? What? People love Elvis, people love comics!' So I was infuriated with Marvel and didn't renew my contract.\" [1]  To reach their target audience, Marvel suggested that the comics also be sold as concert merchandise. However, only  Marty Stuart  took up this recommendation; subsequently,  Marty Party in Space  was among the best-selling titles under the Marvel Music imprint, alongside the  Rolling Stones '  Voodoo Lounge . [1]  \n With Marvel heading into bankruptcy, the imprint was discontinued in 1995. [1]  In retrospect, Stewart felt that \"Maybe it was doomed from the beginning, there just wasn\u2019t enough of a market. Was it because we couldn\u2019t get into the record stores? I don\u2019t know.\" [1]  The Marvel Music brand has since been repurposed as a unit of  Marvel Studios  that publishes its  film soundtracks . [1] \n \n Titles [ edit ] \n These comics featured the life stories of famous musicians and bands, while some were album-oriented mini-dramas, drawn song lyrics or superhero fantasies.

Cartoons, Inc.   Eddie Selzer  then became the production executive until 1958. [2]   John W. Burton  then became producer for a few years until Burton accepted a position of another company that Leon Schlesinger founded called  Pacific Title and Art . DePatie became production executive in 1961, taking over for Burton.\n In 1962, with the decline in moviegoing, DePatie was informed that the cartoon studio was going to be shut down. Shortly afterwards when Warner Bros. Cartoons closed down in 1963, significant production changes occurred for new Warner Bros. cartoons produced by the newly formed  DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises . DePatie received on-screen production credit and cartoon director  Friz Freleng  was promoted to producer. [3]   Chuck Jones  left for  Tom and Jerry  theatricals and television adaptations. Character appearances were limited to  Granny ,  Porky Pig ,  Daffy Duck ,  Sylvester ,  Speedy Gonzales ,  Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner ,  The Goofy Gophers , and  Witch Hazel . Production was subcontracted to  Format Films .\n \n DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises [ edit ] \n While he held his production position at Warner Bros., DePatie originally received no on-screen credit, similar to his two predecessors after Leon Schlesinger retired in 1944. In 1963, he began to receive on-screen credit with new producer (and former director)  Friz Freleng . Around this time, they formed  DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises , also known as DePatie\u2013Freleng Entertainment, and known on-screen as \"DFE Films\".\n \n The Pink Panther [ edit ] \n DePatie and Freleng animated opening segments for some of  Pink Panther  feature films. In these, a Pink Panther appeared in the opening credits as the villain. Music was scored by  Henry Mancini .  The character  would appear in many animated shorts  of his own , also produced by DePatie\u2013Freleng. When these shorts aired on television, they were paired with backup segments. Music was composed by  William Lava ,  Walter Greene , Doug Goodwin and David DePatie's son Steve DePatie. These cartoons were directed by many people including  Arthur Davis ,  Robert McKimson ,  Hawley Pratt , and  Gerry Chiniquy .\n \n Dr. Seuss television specials [ edit ] \n Chuck Jones was producing Dr. Seuss specials for  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , until MGM shut down its animation studio. DePatie\u2013Freleng picked up production of  The Cat in the Hat . Music was composed by  Dean Elliott  for four Dr. Seuss specials,  Hawley Pratt  directed three specials, and  Maurice Noble  was production designer for three specials. Chuck Jones co-produced with  Ted Geisel  while DePatie and Freleng were executive producers for  The Cat in the Hat  only. Since Jones was working for  ABC , he stopped working on  Dr. Seuss specials. Freleng and Ted Geisel became producer but were credited separately. DePatie was the only one credited as executive producer. Music was scored by  Joe Raposo  for three later specials. DePatie\u2013Freleng's last Dr. Seuss special was  The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat , which was around the time that DFE became part of  Cadence Industries , and rebranded as  Marvel Productions .\n \n Marvel Productions [ edit ] \n DePatie and some of his production staff worked for Marvel Productions. He was an executive producer. [4]  He left the company in 1984, and then briefly worked for  Hanna-Barbera , producing  Pink Panther and Sons , before retiring.\n \n References [ edit ] \n \n \n ^   Think Pink: The Story of DePatie-Freleng .

[3] [4]  The park was part of the  City of Arabia  development project, a part of  Dubailand , which was stalled due to the  2008 property crash . [5] [6]  In April 2014, the park got a Dh1.2 billion loan from the  Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank . [7] [4]  The park itself is valued over Dh3.6 Billion. [8]  Developers predict that the park will welcome 10,000 visitors daily, and has the capacity to hold up to 20,000 daily. [6] [9]  The complex was originally set to open in early 2014, has been since been delayed to late 2014, and again to August 15, 2016 [8]   The IMG Group stated in January 2014 that the foundations for the rides were nearly complete and that the structure of the building is complete. [10] \n The park includes 17 themed rides. [6] \n In December 2016, IMG Worlds announced the 2nd theme park called \"IMG Worlds of Legends\". The 2nd park will be adjacent to IMG Worlds of Adventure and is expected to have nine unique zones and attractions from other brands, such as  Nickelodeon  (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants),  Ubisoft  (Assassin's Creed, Raving Rabbids, Just Dance),  Saban Brands  (Power Rangers),  Pok\u00e9mon ,  Mattel  (Barbie, Hot Wheels, Bob the Builder, Thomas & Friends, Mega Bloks), The Anime Zone (including  Toei Animation  (Dragon Ball Z & One Piece) and  TV Tokyo  (Naruto)),  Cartoon Network  (We Bare Bears), Legends of Arabia, and Lost Valley \u2013 Dinosaur Adventure. [11] \n \n Themed areas [ edit ] \n The park contains four themed areas, called \"Epic Zones\". [12]  The park also contains a 12-screen cinema. [8]   Falcon's Creative Group  was the primary firm involved in master planning process.

The company is a wholly owned  subsidiary  of  The Walt Disney Company , and is mainly known for its  Marvel Comics .\n In 2009, The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment for  US$4 billion ; [2]  it has been a  limited liability company  (LLC) since then. For financial reporting purposes, Marvel is primarily reported as part of Disney's  Consumer Products  segment ever since  Marvel Studios ' reorganization from Marvel Entertainment into  Walt Disney Studios . [3] \n Over the years, Marvel Entertainment has entered into several partnerships and negotiations with other companies across a variety of businesses. As of 2019 [update] , Marvel has film licensing agreements with  Sony Pictures  (for  Spider-Man films ) and  Universal Pictures  (a  right of first refusal  to pick up the distribution rights to any  future Hulk films  produced by Marvel Studios), and theme park licensing agreements with  IMG Worlds of Adventure  and  Universal Parks & Resorts  (for specific Marvel character rights at  Islands of Adventure  and  Universal Studios Japan ).

(Marvel or MEG), incorporated on  December 2, 1986 , [6]  and included  Marvel Comics  and  Marvel Productions . That year, it was sold to New World Entertainment Ltd as part of the liquidation of  Cadence Industries . [8]  On January 6, 1989,  Ronald Perelman 's  MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings  bought Marvel Entertainment Group from New World for $82.5 million. [9]  The deal did not include  Marvel Productions , which was folded into New World's TV and movie business. [8] \n \"It is a mini-Disney in terms of intellectual property,\" said Perelman. \"Disney's got much more highly recognized characters and softer characters, whereas our characters are termed action heroes. But at Marvel we are now in the business of the creation and marketing of characters.\" [1] \n \n Public offering and acquisition \n Marvel made an  initial public offering  of 40% of the stock (ticker symbol NYSE:MRV) on July 15, 1991, giving $40 million from the proceeds to Andrews Group, Marvel's then direct parent corporation within MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings. [9] [10] \n In the early 1990s, Marvel Entertainment Group began expanding though acquisitions and the formation of new divisions. Marvel purchased the  trading card  company  Fleer  on July 24, 1992. [9]  On April 30, 1993, Marvel acquired 46% of  ToyBiz , which gave the company the rights to make Marvel toys. [9]  The Andrews Group named  Avi Arad  of ToyBiz as the president and CEO of the  Marvel Films  division. [11] \n In 1993 and 1994, Marvel's  holding companies , Marvel Holdings, Inc. and Marvel Parent Holdings, Inc., were formed between Andrews Group and MEG. The companies issued over half a billion dollars in bonds under the direction of Perelman, which was passed up in dividends to Perlman's group of companies. [12]  Marvel acquired  Panini Group , an Italian sticker-maker, and  Heroes World Distribution , a regional distributor to comic-book shops, in 1994. It acquired trading card company  SkyBox International  in 1995. [9] \n Marvel's attempt to distribute its products directly led to a decrease in sales and aggravated the losses which Marvel suffered when the  comic book bubble [13] [ citation needed ]  popped, the  1994 Major League Baseball strike  massacred the profits of the Fleer unit, [14]  and Panini, whose revenue depended largely on Disney licensing, was hobbled by poor Disney showings at the box office. [15] \n \n Bankruptcy and Marvel Studios \n In late 1995, Marvel reported its first annual loss under Perelman, which was attributed mainly to the company's large size and a shrinking market.  [9]  On January 4, 1996 Marvel laid off 275 employees. [16] \n In late 1996, Perelman proposed a plan to save Marvel in which the company would merge with Toy Biz after Perelman spent $350 million for the Toy Biz shares that he didn't already own. He would then receive newly issued Marvel shares to maintain his 80 percent stake. [9]  \n Separately, in July 1996, Marvel filed with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  to raise money to create a private entity called  Marvel Studios . [17]  Much of the money to create Marvel Studios came from the sale of  Toy Biz  stock. [17] [18] \n In December 1996, the Marvel group of companies filed for bankruptcy. [1] [9]  At this time,  Carl Icahn , an American businessman and investor, began buying Marvel's bonds at 20% of their value and moved to block Perelman's plan. [9]  In February 1997, Icahn won the bankruptcy court's approval to take control of the company's stock. [9]  Later, in June 1997, Icahn won the right to replace Marvel's board, including Perelman. [9]  \n In December 1997, during the post-bankruptcy reorganization phase, Toy Biz came to an agreement to purchase Marvel from the banks.

[31] \n \n Marvel Entertainment \n In September 2005, Marvel Enterprises changed its name to Marvel Entertainment to reflect the corporation's expansion into financing  its own movie slate .

[42] \n Stan Lee Media 's lawsuit against Marvel was dismissed again in February 2011. [34] [43] \n In March 2013,  Feld Entertainment  agreed with Marvel to produce a  Marvel Character-based live arena show .

[54]  The Kirby estate filed a petition on March 21, 2014 for a review of the case by the  Supreme Court of the United States , [55] [56]  but a settlement was reached on September 26, 2014 and the family requested that the petition be dismissed.

[5]  His mother, Ann Lee (n\u00e9e Jeffries) Stearns, originally from  Kentucky , was a teacher at  Riverdale Country School  as Lee Whedon, [6] [7]  and an aspiring novelist. [5]  His parents had both acted, and appeared in a play together at the  Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club . [7]  Whedon is the younger sibling of Samuel and Matthew Whedon and older sibling of writers  Jed  and  Zack Whedon . [8]  At a young age, he showed great interest in British television with series like  Masterpiece  and  Monty Python . [9] \n Whedon attended Riverdale Country School in New York City where his mother taught history. [10]  He then spent three years at  Winchester College  in England, [11]  where, taking note of omnipresent bullying, he concluded, \"it was clear to me from the start that I must take an active role in my survival\". [10]  Whedon graduated from  Wesleyan University  in 1987, where he was awarded an honorary  Doctor of Letters  in 2013. [12]  There, he also studied under renowned academic  Richard Slotkin . [13]  After leaving Wesleyan, Whedon came up with the first incarnation of  Buffy Summers , \"Rhonda, the Immortal Waitress\". [14] \n \n Career [ edit ] \n 1980s\u20131990s [ edit ] \n Early work [ edit ] \n From 1989 to 1990, Whedon worked as a staff writer on the sitcoms  Roseanne  and  Parenthood . [15] [16]  As a  script doctor , Whedon was an uncredited writer on films including  The Getaway ,  Speed ,  Waterworld , and  Twister . [17]   X-Men , on which Whedon worked on an early draft, contained at least two dialogue exchanges of Whedon's contribution, [18]  while the final cut of  Speed  left in most of his dialogue. [19]  While he was script consulting, he also wrote  Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2014the film that would precede the series\u2014 Alien Resurrection  and an early draft for  Atlantis: The Lost Empire [20]  and co-wrote  Toy Story  and  Titan A.E. , the former of which earned him a shared  Academy Award  nomination for Best Original Screenplay. [21] [22] [23]  Whedon has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the released versions of the films  Buffy the Vampire Slayer ,  Titan A.E.  and  Alien Resurrection . [17] [22] [24] \n \n Buffy the Vampire Slayer [ edit ] \n    (From left to right)  Tom Lenk ,  Emma Caulfield ,  Alexis Denisof ,  Alyson Hannigan ,  Anthony Head , Whedon and  Michelle Trachtenberg  at the  Buffy  wrap party. \n In 1997, Whedon created his first television series,  Buffy the Vampire Slayer . 2  The series depicts  Buffy Summers , the latest in a line of young women called to battle against  vampires ,  demons , and other forces of darkness. The idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie\". [25]  Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero. [26]  This conception came from \"the very first mission statement of the show, which was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it\". [27]  The writing process came together from conversations about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers, and how she would confront them in her battle against supernatural forces. [28]  Whedon usually directed episodes from his own scripts that held the most cathartic moments in Buffy's story. [29] [30] [31] \n The series received numerous awards and nominations, including an  Emmy Award  nomination for the 1999 episode \" Hush \". [32]  The 2001 episode \" The Body \" was nominated for a  Nebula Award  in 2002, [33]  and the fall 2001 musical episode \" Once More, with Feeling \" was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation  Hugo Award  and a Best Script Nebula Award. [34] [35]  The final episode \" Chosen \" was nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form Hugo Award in 2003. [36]  All written and directed by Whedon, they are considered some of the most effective and popular episodes of the series. [37] [38] \n Scholar A. Asbj\u00f8rn J\u00f8n recognized that the series has shifted the way vampires have since been depicted in popular culture representations. [39]  Since the end of the series, Whedon has stated that his initial intention was to produce a \" cult \" television series and acknowledged a corresponding \"rabid, almost insane fan base\" that subsequently emerged. In June 2012,  Slate  magazine identified it as the most written about popular culture text of all time. \"[M]ore than twice as many papers, essays, and books have been devoted to the vampire drama than any of our other choices\u2014so many that we stopped counting when we hit 200\". [40] \n A lifelong comic book fan, Whedon authored the  Dark Horse Comics  miniseries  Fray , which takes place in the far future of the  Buffyverse . [41]  Like many writers of the show, he contributed to the series' comic book continuation, writing for the anthology  Tales of the Slayers , [42]  and the main storyline of the miniseries  Tales of the Vampires . [43]  Whedon and the other writers then released a new ongoing series, taking place after the series finale \"Chosen\", which he officially recognizes as the canonical  eighth season . [44]  Whedon returned to the world of  Fray  during the season eight-story arc \" Time of Your Life \". [45]   Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine  was published from August 2011 to September 2013, [46] [47]  for which Whedon wrote \"Freefall, Part I\u2013II\" (with  Andrew Chambliss ). [48] \n \n Angel [ edit ] \n As a result of the success of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Whedon was allowed the opportunity to make his 1999 spin-off series,  Angel . David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot that was going to be developed for  The WB Network . [49]  During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon's original concept. \" Corrupt \", a precociously optioned second episode, was entirely abandoned due to the gloominess written into the script. [50]  The tone was consequently softened, establishing in the opening episodes  Angel Investigations  as an idealistic, shoestring operation. It follows  Angel , who works as a private detective in order to \"help the helpless\". [51] \n Though praised for presenting a unique and progressive version of the  archetypal   noir  hero as a sympathetic vampire detective, [52] [53]  it was criticized as being lesser than its parent show, in context of having been derived from a more popular original work. [54]  Despite this, it won a  Saturn Award  for Best Network TV Series [55]  and the three episodes \" Waiting in the Wings \", [56]  \" Smile Time \" and \" Not Fade Away \" were nominated for Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2003 and 2005. [57] \n The WB Network announced on February 13, 2004 that  Angel  would not be brought back for a sixth season. [58]  Whedon said of the cancellation, \"I believe the reason  Angel  had trouble on The WB was that it was the only show on the network that wasn't trying to be  Buffy . It was a show about grown-ups\". [59]  An official continuation of the story came rather in the form of a comic book series. [60]  Following the successful eighth season of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer ,  IDW Publishing  approached Whedon about similarly producing a canonical sixth season for  Angel . [61] [62]   Angel: After the Fall  released 17 issues written by Whedon and  Brian Lynch . [63] \n \n 2000s [ edit ] \n Firefly [ edit ] \n Whedon followed  Angel  with the space western  Firefly , starring  Nathan Fillion ,  Gina Torres ,  Alan Tudyk ,  Morena Baccarin ,  Adam Baldwin ,  Jewel Staite ,  Sean Maher ,  Summer Glau  and  Ron Glass . [64]  Set in the year 2517, [65]   Firefly  explores the lives of the people who, on the outskirts of society, make their living as the crew of  Serenity , a \"Firefly- class \" spaceship. [66]  The series' original concept progressed after Whedon read  The Killer Angels , a book on the  Battle of Gettysburg . [64] [67] \n An ever-present element was Whedon's injection of  anti-totalitarianism , [68]  writing into the show a historical analogy of the Battle of Gettysburg, the \"Battle of Serenity Valley\". 3 [69]  The beaten soldiers were called \" Browncoats \" after the brown  dusters  they wore as their uniforms. [70] [71]  Whedon said, \"I wanted to play with that classic notion of the frontier: not the people who made history, but the people history stepped on\u2014the people for whom every act is the creation of civilization\". [72]   Firefly  was written as a serious character study, [73]  encompassing what Whedon called \"life when it's hard\", and in elaboration was about \"nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things\". [74] \n Fox chose to play the episodes of the series out of order, running  The Train Job  first, and not airing the pilot until a dozen episodes later, resulting in some confusion from viewers. The series was also promoted as a comedy, not a science fiction drama, and placed in the infamous \" Friday night death slot \". The show was praised by critics overall, but some objected to the fusion of  American frontier  and  outer space  motifs. [75] [76] [77]  Faced with these hurdles, the show had an average of 4.7\u00a0million viewers at the time and was ranked 98th in  Nielsen ratings . The series was cancelled by Fox before all of the episodes had aired. [78]  Whedon took to  Universal Pictures  as a means of achieving a continuation of the story. [79]  Following  Firefly  was  Serenity , a follow-up film taking place after the events of the  final episode . [80]  This developed into a  franchise  that led to graphic novels, books and other media. [81] [82] [83]   New Scientist  magazine held a poll in 2005 to find \"The World's Best Space Sci-Fi Ever\", in which  Firefly  and  Serenity  took first and second place, respectively. [84]  It also received an Emmy shortly after its cancellation, and a number of other awards. Since its cancellation, the series has attained cult status. [85] \n \n Marvel Comics [ edit ] \n In 2004, Whedon created the comic book line  Astonishing X-Men . [86] [87]  He finished his 24 issue run in 2008 and then handed over the writing reins to  Warren Ellis . [88] [89]  One storyline from this comic, the notion of a cure for mutation being found, was also an element in the third X-Men film,  X-Men: The Last Stand . [90] [91]  In February 2009,  Astonishing X-Men  #6, which depicted the return of  Colossus  to the title, and concluded Whedon's first story arc, was named by readers as #65 in Marvel's Top 70 Comics of all time. [92] \n Taking over after series creator  Brian K. Vaughan  completed his run, Whedon became the second writer of the Marvel comic  Runaways . [93]  Having already been a committed reader, he had a letter published in the first volume, which was included in the Volume 1 hardcover edition. [94]  He also wrote short pieces for  Stan Lee Meets Spider-Man  and  Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men  #1, [95] [96]  and was the subject of an issue of  Marvel Spotlight  (alongside artist  Michael Lark ). [97]  As part of a panel of writers, he contributed to Marvel Comics'  Civil War  crossover event, lending advice in how to tell the story and how to end it. [98]  In March 2016, Whedon contributed a story for the 75th anniversary issue of  Captain America :  Sam Wilson  with  Astonishing X-Men  collaborator  John Cassaday . [99]  Whedon introduced several new characters into the  Marvel Universe  such as the villainous  Ord , [100]  X-Men  Ruth \"Blindfold\" Aldine  and  Hisako \"Armor\" Ichiki , [101] [102]  Runaway  Klara Prast , [103]  and  Special Agent Abigail Brand  along with  S.W.O.R.D. , the organization she commands. [104] [105] \n \n Serenity [ edit ] \n After Universal Pictures acquired the  film  and  distribution rights  from Fox, Whedon started writing the screenplay for  Serenity . [106] [107]  Transforming the series into a film, he says, \"...was the hardest piece of writing I've ever done ... It had to be self-contained and work as a movie, which meant I had to cope with problems like introducing nine main characters who'd already met!\" [108] [109]  The script was based on unused story ideas for  Firefly ' s unfilmed second season. [80]  On writing the dialogue, Whedon felt that part of it came from \"getting to invent the language\", which \"once I had ... reads like a kind of poetry\". [110]  The narrative centers on Captain  Malcolm Reynolds  as the hero accompanied by  River Tam  acting as the catalyst for what he does. [111] \n The score was composed by  David Newman , and according to Whedon was intended to \"deglorify space\u2014to feel the intimacy of being on a ship as opposed to the grandeur\". [112]  He used two  long   steadicam  shots for several minutes of the film's opening sequence to establish \"a sense of safety in space\". [113] [114]  In 2006, it won a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form. [115]  The elements of science fiction that Whedon wanted to convey were essentially different in kind, and held \"a sort of grittiness\" and \"realism\", which he said, together, \"get the most exciting kind of film-making\". [116]  Like  Firefly , the film contained a statement on  individual liberty . [117]  Critic  Roger Ebert  observed, \"Like  Brave New World  and  1984 , the movie plays like a critique of contemporary society, with the Alliance as Big Brother, enemy of discontent\". [118]  The film received the 2005  Nebula Award for Best Script , the 2006  Prometheus Special Award , [119] [120]  and was voted the best sci-fi movie of all time in a poll set up by  SFX magazine . [116]  There have since been multiple rumors regarding sequel possibilities. [121] [122] \n The limited three-issue comic book series called  Serenity: Those Left Behind , the story of which was written by Whedon, [123]  was released in 2005 as a tie-in to  Serenity . Set between  Firefly  and the film, it was intended to connect the two storylines. [124]   Serenity: Better Days  also spanned three issues, [125]  and was written by Whedon and  Brett Matthews . [126]  Whedon later co-wrote  The Shepherd's Tale  with his half brother  Zack . [127] \n \n Freelance directing and  Sugarshock! [ edit ] \n As a guest director, he contributed two 2007 episodes of  The Office  (\" Business School \" and \" Branch Wars \") [128] [129]  and a 2010 episode of  Glee  (\" Dream On \"). [130]  Denoting this period, Whedon has said, \"I had free time, but I'm pretty sure I mean my career was on the skids\". [131] \n In collaboration with  F\u00e1bio Moon , Whedon created the free webcomic titled  Sugarshock! , as part of the revival of  Dark Horse Presents , which was launched on  Myspace . [132]  Whedon later executive produced another free comic book on the Internet,  Serenity: The Other Half . [133] \n \n Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [ edit ] \n    Whedon with the cast and crew of  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog  at its  Creative Artists Agency  theater screening. \n As a response to the  2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike , [134]  Whedon directed, co-wrote and produced  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog . [135]  It tells the story of Dr. Horrible, an aspiring supervillain, who shares a love interest in a girl named Penny with his nemesis, Captain Hammer. [136]  To Whedon the miniseries was \"a project of love\", an accomplishment that from their excitement would be embellished with passion and \"ridiculousness\". [137]  His half brothers Zack and  Jed  and sister-in-law  Maurissa Tancharoen  share the other writing credits. [138]  Whedon said it was a \"glorious surprise\" to him to discover how well they worked together. [139] \n After having attended meetings with companies discussing the prospect of producing something for the Internet, and faced with negative feedback on his ideas, he realized that as long as the strike was still in progress, acquiring corporate funding was an unlikely prospect. [134]  Whedon funded the project himself with the investment of just over $200,000, [136]  and earned more from it than he did directing  The Avengers . [140]  He enjoyed the independence gained from it, as it provided him the freedom to include content without the expectancy of lessening it on behalf of the runtime. [137]  He and Jed composed the music, parts of which were influenced by  Stephen Sondheim . [141] \n The miniseries was nominated and won numerous awards. Whedon was awarded Best Directing and Best Writing for a Comedy Web Series at the  Streamy Awards , [142]  a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, [143]  and a  Creative Arts Emmy Award  in 2009. [144] \n \n Dollhouse [ edit ] \n In 2009, Whedon created his fourth television series  Dollhouse , and explored themes throughout the show that were initially present in an unproduced  spec script  of his called  Afterlife . [145]  The series follows Echo, whose brain is programmed to accomplish various assignments, on her journey towards self-awareness. [146] [147]  As stated by Whedon,  Dollhouse  was about \"the sides of us that we don't want people to see\",  sexuality [148]  and, on some level, a celebration of  perversion , [149]  which he equates to  obsession , \"the thing that makes people passionate and interesting and worthy\". [150] \n Despite low ratings in its first season, the series was renewed for a second and final season. The reason for the renewal given by Fox's president of entertainment was to avoid any backlash that would have resulted from its cancelation. [151] [152]  In reflection of Fox's disruptive involvement, Whedon lamented the loss of ideas of  identity  and  moral   culpability , stating that they were dancing around them in the process [150]  which then devolved it into a  procedural . [148] \n \n 2010s [ edit ] \n The Cabin in the Woods [ edit ] \n Whedon co-wrote and produced a horror-comedy film titled  The Cabin in the Woods  with director  Drew Goddard , which finished production in 2009. [153]  Whedon and Goddard both intended to make a film that concerned horror movies while still preserving the fun and frightening elements necessary to itself be a horror film. [154]  The script was written in three days, [155]  producing a minimum of 15 pages a day. [156]  Whedon described it as an attempt to revitalize horror, calling it a \"loving hate letter\" to the genre, continuing:\n \n .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} On another level it's a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies. I love being scared. I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be alright but at the same time hoping they'll go somewhere dark and face something awful. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into  torture porn  and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction. [157] \n \n Part of what Whedon thought distinguished it from other horror films was that people were not expendable\u2014\"As a culture, for our own entertainment, we tend to assume that they are\". [158]  He reiterated his sentiment that the introduction of torture porn into this genre was becoming an exercise in nihilism and misogyny as a means to promote distress instead of trying to scare you. [159] \n \n Marvel Studios [ edit ] \n    Whedon with the cast of  The Avengers  and  Kevin Feige  at the 2010  San Diego Comic-Con International . \n In July 2010, it was confirmed that Whedon would write and direct  The Avengers , a live-action adaptation of the superhero team  of the same name . [160]  On his desire to take on the film, he explained that the core of the movie was about \"finding yourself from community\" and the togetherness derived from a group that ultimately doesn't belong together. [161] \n It became the  fourth-highest-grossing film  of all time at the North American box office, [162]  and received considerable praise from critics. [163] [164]  In retrospect, Whedon thought the film had \"imperfections,\" [165]  begrudging its quality in comparison to that of  The Matrix  and  The Godfather Part II . Nonetheless, he felt he \"pulled off\" the endeavor of making a summer movie reminiscent of those from his childhood. [166] \n In March 2012, Whedon stated that although television involves more compromise than film:\n \n I think, ultimately, gun to my head, TV is the place. Being able to spend years with a character, to really develop them, to understand them, to challenge the actor, to learn from the actor, to work with a team of writers\u00a0\u2013 that experience is so fulfilling. The idea of putting something out there and letting it grow is really exciting. [167] \n \n In August 2012, Whedon signed a deal to develop the  Marvel  TV show  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  for  ABC . [168] [169]  The series focuses on the secret military law-enforcement agency featured throughout the  Marvel Cinematic Universe . [170]  Created by Whedon, Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, [171]  the show involves individuals who possess powers within the spectacle of science fiction, while also focusing on \"the peripheral people ... the people on the edges of the grand adventures.\" [172]  The character  Phil Coulson  was resurrected after his death in  The Avengers  to helm the show. [173] \n Whedon spoke about certain complications that factored in with making the show for Marvel, noting confusion between him and the company regarding the degree to which they wanted him to create it, citing their demand that he prioritize  Avengers: Age of Ultron . [174]  He once expressed regrets for having brought back Phil Coulson, feeling that his death had lost meaning as a result, [175]  but later clarified that he did not regret this decision. [176] \n Whedon returned to write and direct the  sequel to  The Avengers , [168] [177]  following the deal with  Marvel Studios , which expired in June 2015. [178]  On the matter of approaching a sequel, Whedon reasoned not to go \"bigger\" but \"deeper,\" and likened it to digging with a scalpel to cause pain. [179]  He said of the film's characters, \"Strong but damaged by power describes every person in this movie. It may, in fact, describe what the movie is about ... the more power that we have, the less human we are.\" [180]  Whedon discerns that  Age of Ultron  \"is an odd film\" [181]  that proved challenging when it came to finding the rhythm between both its calm and exciting moments. Drawing parallels to a symphony, he wanted to bring about \"grace in the middle of ultimate chaos.\" [182] \n Whedon also served as a creative consultant on the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe leading up to  Age of Ultron . [183] [184]  He rewrote some dialogue for  Thor: The Dark World , [185]  directed the mid-credits scene of  Captain America: The Winter Soldier , [186]  and suggested that  James Gunn  make  Guardians of the Galaxy  \"weirder\" after reading an early draft. [187]  Whedon said it was unlikely that he would return to make another sequel, stating that he \"couldn't imagine doing this again.\" [188]  He remarked that not having created his own fictional universe in over five years felt wrong [189]  and intended to use the proceeds made from  Avengers: Age of Ultron  for such ventures. [140]  In January 2016, Whedon announced that he will no longer work with Marvel. [176] \n \n Much Ado About Nothing [ edit ] \n To create  Much Ado About Nothing , Whedon established  Bellwether Pictures . [190]  He filmed it in black-and-white on digital video over a period of 12 days at his residence in Santa Monica, California. [191] [192]  The film was scripted, produced, directed, edited and composed by Whedon, based on  William Shakespeare 's  play of the same name . [193]  His idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having \"Shakespeare readings\" at his house with several of his friends, years prior. [194]  Despite the play's comedy, he discovered that there were elements in the text \"of debauchery\" that brought out a core darkness, and said the visual nature of  film  influenced him to permeate a motif of sexuality into the script. [195] \n \n In Your Eyes  and  Twist [ edit ] \n Whedon wrote and executive produced the paranormal romance film  In Your Eyes , the second feature by Bellwether Pictures. [196] [197]  The film tells the story of Rebecca Porter and Dylan Kershaw who can feel each other's emotions, but are ultimately strangers. [198]  Whedon's script marked a theme of human connection as the metaphor for the couple's mysterious link. [199]  He conceived the idea in the early 1990s, and had written drafts of the screenplay since then. [200] \n In summer 2014, Whedon encountered artist Shawnee Kilgore on  Kickstarter . Whedon funded her album and when Kilgore contacted him about his fulfillment reward, he suggested they make a song together. She agreed, and the collaboration was later repurposed into producing an  EP . [201] \n At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon announced  Twist , which was described as a comic book about \"a Victorian female Batman\". [202] \n In 2017, Whedon directed  Unlocked , a short film in support of  Planned Parenthood . [203] [204] \n \n Justice League [ edit ] \n In May 2017, Whedon took over post-production duties for  Justice League , including writing, and directing additional photography for the film. [205]  He received a co-writing credit for his contributions to the film, which was released in November 2017. He did not receive a co-director credit however, despite reshooting and changing most of the film from what Zack Snyder had already filmed, completed, and intended. [206] \n \n Upcoming projects [ edit ] \n On October 20, 2016, Whedon revealed that he is currently writing a new project that is a historical fiction/horror film set during  World War II . [207] [208] \n On July 13, 2018,  HBO  announced that the network had obtained the rights to  The Nevers , an \"epic science fiction drama about a gang of Victorian women who find themselves with unusual abilities, relentless enemies, and a mission that might change the world\", on which Whedon will serve as writer, director, executive producer, and showrunner. [209] \n \n Unrealized projects [ edit ] \n Main article:  Joss Whedon's unrealized projects \n Early in his career, Whedon sold two  spec scripts  that were not produced,  Suspension  and  Afterlife . He sold  Suspension  for $750,000, with an additional $250,000 if production had commenced. [210]  In September 2014,  Empire  suggested the script 4  was being made, with  Liam Neeson  attached to the project. [211]  In 1994, he sold  Afterlife  for $1.5\u00a0million, with an additional $500,000 if production had commenced. In 2000,  Andy Tennant  was in talks to direct and rewrite. [212]  In  Afterlife  there were precursors to themes Whedon would later explore in  Dollhouse . The script was about Daniel Hoffstetter, a government scientist, who awakes after dying to discover his mind has been imprinted on a mind-wiped body. [213] \n Whedon had a number of planned  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  spinoffs  that became stuck in development or terminally stalled. Among these were  Buffy the Animated Series , a set of television movies for The WB based on  Angel  and  Buffy  characters, [214] [215]  a  Spike  spin-off film, [216] [217]  and  Ripper , a proposed BBC pilot about  Rupert Giles . [218] \n Goners  was announced in 2005. According to  Variety  magazine, it was a fantasy thriller under development by  Universal Pictures , and was to be produced by  Mary Parent  and  Scott Stuber . [219]  From a 2006 interview with  Fanboy Radio : \"I've been seeing a lot of horror movies that are  torture-porn , where kids we don't care about are mutilated for hours, and I just cannot abide them... it's an antidote to that very kind of film, the horror movie with the expendable human beings in it. Because I don't believe any human beings are\". [220] \n Whedon was hired to write and direct a  Warner Bros.  adaptation of  Wonder Woman . However, in February 2007, Whedon announced that he would no longer be involved with the project. \"We just saw different movies, and at the price range this kind of movie hangs in, that's never gonna work. Non-sympatico. It happens all the time\". [221]  Conversely, he stated, \"the fact of the matter is, it was a waste of my time. We never [wanted] to make the same movie; none of us knew that\". [222]  Whedon also pitched a screenplay to adapt  Batman  for the same company as development started on what would eventually become  Batman Begins . [223]  It was described as having included a new, \"more of a ' Hannibal Lecter ' type\" villain, and portrayed Bruce Wayne as \"a morbid, death-obsessed kid\" whose grief was overcome by protecting a girl from being bullied in an alley similar to where his parents were murdered. [224]  In March 2017, Whedon was in negotiations to direct, write, and produce  Batgirl  set in the  DC Extended Universe . [225]  He withdrew from the project in February 2018, saying he didn't have a story for the movie. [226] \n The sequel to  Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog  has been shelved on multiple occasions. In 2009, Whedon remarked upon the possibility of presenting it in the form of another miniseries or a feature film. [227]  The script was planned to be written in summer 2012 and the principal photography to take place the following year. [228] [229]  However, production was delayed because of his commitment to projects at  Marvel Studios . [230] \n Wastelanders , a web-based \"end-of-the-world\" project, once in development with author  Warren Ellis , was postponed due to Whedon's preoccupation with  The Avengers . [231] \n \n Themes, style and influences [ edit ] \n .mw-parser-output .quotebox{background-color:#F9F9F9;border:1px solid #aaa;box-sizing:border-box;padding:10px;font-size:88%;max-width:100%}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft{margin:0.5em 1.4em 0.8em 0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright{margin:0.5em 0 0.8em 1.4em}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.centered{margin:0.5em auto 0.8em auto}.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatleft p,.mw-parser-output .quotebox.floatright p{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-title{background-color:#F9F9F9;text-align:center;font-size:larger;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:before{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" \u201c \";vertical-align:-45%;line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox-quote.quoted:after{font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:large;color:gray;content:\" \u201d \";line-height:0}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .left-aligned{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .right-aligned{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .quotebox .center-aligned{text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .quotebox cite{display:block;font-style:normal}@media screen and (max-width:360px){.mw-parser-output .quotebox{min-width:100%;margin:0 0 0.8em!important;float:none!important}} \n Everybody has a perspective. Everybody in your scene, including the thug flanking your bad guy, has a reason. They have their own voice, their own identity, their own history. If anyone speaks in such a way that they're just setting up the next person's lines, then you don't get dialogue: you get soundbites. \n \u2014 Whedon on giving each character a distinct voice. [232] \n \n \n Thematically, Whedon's work often explores perspectives on  existentialism , [233]   anti-authoritarianism , [68]   free will , [234]   power , [27]  powerlessness,  sexuality , [235]   adulthood ,  sacrifice ,  misogyny  and  feminism . [236] [237] [238] [239]  His projects usually revolve around an ensemble of  protagonists , [240] [241]  primarily focused on a  loner   hero  who ends up working with others to accomplish a goal. [242]  He says of the recurring aspects of community, \"Everything I write tends to turn into a superhero team, even if I didn't mean for it to. I always start off wanting to be solitary, because a) it's simpler, and b) that isolation is something that I relate to as a storyteller. And then no matter what, I always end up with a team\". [243]  Examining a typical motif, he says, \"I tend to write about people who are helpless or out of control who then regain or retake control\". [236] \n Articulating his approach to screenwriting, Whedon has noted outlining and  act structure  as the hardest parts of storytelling, but emphasizes that he feels they are \"completely essential\". [244] [245]  Many of Whedon's altered phrases and heavily popularized words have entered a common usage called \" Slayer Slang \", which  PBS  included an entire section of in their article series  Do You Speak American? . [246]  In an issue of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight , where Buffy travels to the future, Whedon writes Buffy's reaction to the future dialect of Manhattan; this allows Whedon to comment on the series' distinctive style of dialogue; \"Buffy blames herself for what's happened to the English language, and there's a lot of hubris in that joke. I like to think that adding Y's to words that don't usually have Y's is going to destroy the whole fabric of our society\". [247]  His use of self-aware dialogue to humanize characters, [248]  which relies heavily on dry humor and  subtext , [249] [250]  treating clich\u00e9s subversively, [251]  using misogyny to define the trait of a villain, [238] [252]  and the recurring theme of self-sacrifice led by subverting  moral   icons  have been defining to his style of storytelling. [253] \n His penchant to kill off characters has been widely acknowledged. [254] [255]  Whedon has admitted extreme tiredness to the criticism, [175] [256]  explaining, \"The percentage of people who die... is a lot. I think it's pretty near everybody. The percentage of people that I kill\u2014not so many. I think the reason that my rep is so nasty is that I tend to do it... unexpectedly, or to someone people are recently invested in, and that is a real mission statement for me, because, death doesn't leave a card. Death doesn't take Hitler. It doesn't work according to story plans, and when a death feels like a loss, gives you grief... then you have told a story that involves death\". [257]  Dramatic effect is used to convey the sense of  realism  and  shock value  that comes from fatal circumstances. [255] \n Whedon has kept ambivalent on whether to shoot on  film  or  digital video , saying that he has \"no allegiance to film as film. If the story is in front of me, I'm fine\". [258]  In terms of visual aesthetics, he prefers to incorporate as many  practical effects  as possible when using  computer-generated imagery , so people \"really don't know where one begins and the other ends\". [259]  On working with  high or low budgets , he remarked that both offer \"the exact same job\" and whether one has $100\u00a0million or $100,000, \"you're trying to hit someone in the gut with an emotional moment\". [260]  Whedon determines that, although giving actors notes for guidance, he also aims to assuage their concerns when communicating the reasons and outcomes of a scene. [261] \n Whedon has cited  Ray Bradbury , [262]   James Cameron , [263]   Rod Serling , [264]   William Shakespeare , [265]   Stephen Sondheim , [266]   Steven Spielberg , [267]   Charles Dickens ,  Stan Lee ,  Robert Klein ,  Jerome Robbins ,  Frank Borzage ,  Steve Gerber ,  Steven Bochco ,  Frances Hodgson Burnett  and  John Williams  as influences. [264]  When asked about his five favorite films, Whedon listed  The Matrix ,  Once Upon a Time in the West ,  The Bad and the Beautiful ,  Magnolia  and  The Court Jester . [268] \n \n Feminism and claims of infidelity [ edit ] \n \n Equality is not a concept. It's not something we should be striving for. It's a necessity. Equality is like gravity, we need it to stand on this earth as men and women, and the misogyny that is in every culture is not a true part of the human condition. It is life out of balance, and that imbalance is sucking something out of the soul of every man and woman who's confronted with it. We need equality. Kinda now. \n \u2014 Whedon's 2006 Equality Now speech. [269] \n \n \n Elements of feminism are present throughout much of Whedon's work, [239] [270]  which he gives his mother credit for inspiring. [271]  The character  Kitty Pryde  from the  X-Men  comics was an early model for Whedon's strong teenage girl characters. [272]  He said, \"If there's a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don't know what it was. She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it\". [273]  Kitty Pryde later played a central role in Whedon's run on  Astonishing X-Men . [274]  In response to perennially being asked why he writes such  strong female characters , he replied, \"Because you're still asking me that question.\" [269] \n In college, Whedon studied a theory called \" womb envy \", [239]  a concept he says observes \"a fundamental thing that women have something men don't, the obvious being an ability to bear children. Men not only don't get what's important about what women are capable of, but in fact they fear it, and envy it, and want to throw stones at it, because it's the thing they can't have\". [270]  In 2007, Whedon expressed his outrage over the  murder of Du'a Khalil Aswad , and because the act was caught on video, was prompted to attack the underlying attitude he felt led to the murder, comparing the video to  torture porn . [239] [275] \n In late 2013, Whedon spoke at an Equality Now event, where he issued a pointed dissection of the word \" feminist \". He begins to say, \"I have the privilege living my life inside of words ... but part of being a writer is also living in the very smallest part of every word\". Arguing against the suffix \" -ist \", he continues, \"you can't be born an \u2013ist. It's not natural\". Whedon explains that because of this, the word \"includes the idea that believing men and women to be equal ... is not a natural state. That we don't emerge assuming that everybody in the human race is a human. That the idea of equality is just an idea that's imposed on us...\" [276] [277]  This sparked an unfavorable reaction from the feminist community, [278] [279]  but also an appreciation for Whedon's arguments' thought provocation. [280] [281] \n News website  Digital Spy  released in early 2015 an interview they had conducted with Whedon, during which he criticized the entertainment industry for its \"genuine, recalcitrant, intractable sexism, and old-fashioned quiet misogyny\". [282]  Whedon exemplified  The Hunger Games  film series as an argument for female led franchises, and hoped  Marvel Studios  would pursue production of more such franchises. [283]  However, critics noted an almost stereotypical lack of feminist ideals in his writing decisions and portrayal of  Black Widow , the only female protagonist in Marvel's 2015  Avengers: Age of Ultron , played by  Scarlett Johansson . [284] [285] \n In August 2017, Whedon's ex-wife, Kai Cole, published an essay on an industry trade site accusing Whedon of 15 years of multiple infidelities and the hypocrisy of touting feminist ideals while using their marriage \"as a shield\" for his misuse of power. [286]  A Whedon spokesperson said the essay contained \"inaccuracies and misrepresentations\". [287] \n \n Frequent casting [ edit ] \n Whedon often hires the same actors for his projects, [288]  and has been described as \"the gravitational center of the Whedonverse, a galaxy that spins recurring actors and themes through an orbital system of TV shows, films and comic books that all share similar traits: a unique brand of witty dialogue, relatable characters and fantasy/sci-fi mythology\".

[299]  They have two children together, Arden and Squire. [300] [301]  Whedon and Cole separated in 2012, and divorced in 2016. [302]  In 2017, his ex-wife claimed that Whedon had repeatedly been unfaithful to her and that he \"does not practice what he preaches\" in regard to feminism. [286] \n In 2013, Whedon revealed that he suffers from  workaholism . This arose during the time that followed the completion of  Much Ado About Nothing , which was made in the span of a two-week vacation from  The Avengers , [303]  and after making the pilot for  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  amidst the pre-production for  Avengers: Age of Ultron . \"It is actually a problem. Sometimes it's adorable ... and sometimes it's not ... Not to get all dark and weird, but it is something I need to address\". [304] \n \n Religious and philosophical views [ edit ] \n Whedon has identified himself as an  atheist . [73] [305]  In a piece by  The A.V. Club , he elaborated on his nonbelief in gods: [306] \n \n The A.V. Club : Is there a God? \n Whedon : No. \n The A.V. Club : That's it, end of story, no? \n Whedon : Absolutely not. That's a very important and necessary thing to learn.\n \n \n Whedon has also identified as an  absurdist  and  existentialist . [305]  A committed  humanist , Whedon was presented with the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism by the Humanist Chaplaincy at  Harvard University . [307]  He has also spoken about  existentialism , explaining in detail how it, and more specifically  Jean-Paul Sartre 's  Nausea , was used as a basis for the  Firefly  episode \" Objects in Space \". He called it \"the most important book\" he ever read, [233]  and said it was handed to him right after he saw  Steven Spielberg 's  Close Encounters of the Third Kind , whose impact, he recalls, had made him an existentialist. [308] \n \n Political views [ edit ] \n In July 2012, at the  San Diego Comic-Con International , in response to one woman who noted the  anti-corporate  themes in many of his films, and asked him to give his  economic philosophy  in 30 seconds or less, Whedon spoke out against both  socialism  and  capitalism , stating that \"ultimately all these systems don't work\". [ citation needed ]   He went on to say that America is \"turning into Tsarist Russia\". [309] \n Endorsing  Barack Obama  in the  2012 United States presidential election , [310]  Whedon satirically equated  Mitt Romney 's future as president with a  zombie apocalypse , quipping, \"Romney is ready to make the deep rollbacks in health care, education, social services and reproductive rights that will guarantee poverty, unemployment, overpopulation, disease, rioting\u2014all crucial elements in creating a nightmare zombie wasteland\". [311] [312] \n In 2015, Whedon signed a petition as part of a political campaign calling for  Elizabeth Warren  to run for  President of the United States . [313] [314] \n In January 2017, after actress  Nicole Kidman  publicly suggested that America should accept that Trump is President, Whedon tweeted a photograph of plastic puppet  Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward  alongside an image of Kidman, an action some interpreted as mocking and objectifying Kidman's physical appearance. [315]  That same month, Whedon also received criticism for reportedly comparing  Ivanka Trump  to a dog. [316]  Referring to Ivanka's husband  Jared Kushner  and Trump, he tweeted: \"He's a  Voldemort  in training, & unlike the Pekingese he married under, can play the long game.\" [315] [317]  Whedon stated that he had been referring to  Donald Trump .

Marvel Studios is best known for the production of the  Marvel Cinematic Universe films , which has grossed over $22.5 billion at the global box office as of 2019, with the film  Avengers: Endgame  grossing $2.8 billion worldwide. [5] \n Marvel Studios has released  23 films since 2008 within the Marvel Cinematic Universe , from  Iron Man  (2008) to  Spider-Man: Far From Home  (2019). These films all share  continuity  with each other, along with the  One-Shots  produced by the studio and the  television shows  produced by  Marvel Television . \n In addition to the  Marvel Cinematic Universe , Marvel Studios was also involved with the production of other  Marvel -character film franchises that have exceeded $1 billion in North American box office revenue: the  X-Men  and  Spider-Man  multi-film franchises. \n Marvel Studios is also developing television series which will air on  Disney+ .\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Background \n \n 1.1   Timely era \n 1.2   Marvel Entertainment Group era \n \n \n 2   History \n \n 2.1   Marvel Films \n 2.2   Marvel Studios \n 2.3   Licensing films \n 2.4   Production \n 2.5   Disney conglomerate subsidiary (2009\u2013present) \n 2.6   Disney Studios subsidiary \n \n \n 3   Character rights \n 4   Marvel Knights \n 5   Units \n \n 5.1   Marvel Music \n \n \n 6   Logo \n 7   Production library \n \n 7.1   Films \n 7.2   Television \n \n 7.2.1   Animated \n 7.2.2   Live action \n \n \n \n \n 8   See also \n 9   References \n 10   External links \n \n \n\n Background \n Timely era \n During what is known as Marvel's  Timely era , Captain America was licensed out to  Republic Pictures  for a  serial  just for the free advertising. Timely failed to provide any drawing of Captain America with his shield or any further background, and Republic created a whole new background for the character, and portrayed the character using a gun. [6] \n \n Marvel Entertainment Group era \n In the late 1970s up to the early 1990s,  Marvel Entertainment Group  (MEG) sold options to studios to produce films based on  Marvel Comics characters . One of Marvel's superheroes,  Spider-Man , was optioned in the late 1970s, and rights reverted to Marvel without a film having been produced within the allocated timeframe. From 1986 to 1996, most of Marvel's major characters had been optioned, including the  Fantastic Four ,  X-Men ,  Daredevil ,  Hulk ,  Silver Surfer , and  Iron Man . [7]  A  Howard the Duck   film  made it to the screen in 1986, but was a  box-office flop . MEG was purchased by  New World Entertainment  in November 1986 [8]  and moved to produce films based on the Marvel characters. It released  The Punisher (1989)  before MEG was sold to  Ronald Perelman 's  Andrews Group . Two other films were produced:  Captain America  (1990) released in the United Kingdom on screens and direct to video in the United States, and  The Fantastic Four  (1994), not intended for release. Marvel's rival  DC Comics , on the other hand, had success licensing its properties  Superman  and  Batman  into successful film franchises. [9] \n \n History \n Marvel Films \n    The logo used under the Marvel Films branding. \n Following Marvel Entertainment Group's (MEG) ToyBiz deal in 1993,  Avi Arad  of  ToyBiz  was named President and CEO of Marvel Films division and of New World Family Filmworks, Inc., a New World Entertainment subsidiary. New World was MEG's former parent corporation and later a fellow subsidiary of the Andrews Group. [10] [11]   Marvel Productions  became New World Animation by 1993 as Marvel would start up Marvel Films including Marvel Films Animation. [10] [12] [13]  Marvel Films Animation shared  Tom Tataranowicz  with New World Animation as head of development and production. [14]  New World Animation ( The Incredible Hulk ),  Saban  ( X-Men ) and Marvel Films Animation ( Spider-Man ) each produced a Marvel series for television for the 1996\u20131997 season. [15]  It was Marvel Films Animation's only production. [13] [16]  By the end of 1993, Arad and  20th Century Fox  struck a deal to make a film based on the X-Men. [17] \n New World Animation and Marvel Films Animation were sold along with the rest of New World by Andrews Group to  News Corporation / Fox  as announced in August 1996. As part of the deal, Marvel licensed the rights to Captain America, Daredevil and Silver Surfer to be on  Fox Kids Network  and produced by Saban. New World Animation continued producing a second season of  The Incredible Hulk  for  UPN . [15] [18] \n \n Marvel Studios \n In August 1996, Marvel created Marvel Studios, an incorporation of Marvel Films, due to the sale of  New World Communications Group, Inc. , Marvel's fellow Andrews Group subsidiary in film and television stations, to News Corporation/Fox. Filing with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  to raise money to finance the new corporation, Marvel, Isaac Perlmutter's Zib, Inc. and Avi Arad sold Toy Biz stocks, which Marvel had started and took public in February 1995. [7] [19]  Toy Biz filed an offering of 7.5\u00a0million shares with a closing price of $20.125 at the time, making the offering worth approximately $150\u00a0million. Toy Biz sought to sell 1 million shares, and Marvel sought to sell 2.5\u00a0million shares. [20] \n Jerry Calabrese, the president of Marvel Entertainment Group and Avi Arad, head of Marvel Films and a director of Toy Biz, were assigned tandem control of Marvel Studios. Under Calabrese and Arad, Marvel sought to control  pre-production  by commissioning scripts, hiring directors, and casting characters, providing the package to a major studio partner for filming and distribution. Arad said of the goal for control, \"When you get into business with a big studio, they are developing a hundred or 500 projects; you get totally lost. That isn't working for us. We're just not going to do it anymore. Period.\" [7]  Marvel Studios arranged a seven-year development deal with 20th Century Fox to cover markets in the United States and internationally. [21]  In the following December, Marvel Entertainment Group went through a  reorganization plan , including Marvel Studios as part of its strategic investment. [22]  By 1997, Marvel Studios was actively pursuing various film productions based on Marvel characters, including the eventual films  X-Men  (2000),  Daredevil  (2003),  Elektra  (2005) and  Fantastic Four  (2005). Unproduced projects included  Prince Namor , based on the character  Namor  and to be directed by  Philip Kaufman , and  Mort the Dead Teenager , based on the comic book of the same name and written by John Payson and  Mort  creator  Larry Hama . [23]  \nMarvel was developing a Captain America animated series with Saban Entertainment for Fox Kids Network to premiere in fall 1998. However, due to the bankruptcy the series was canceled after only character designs and a one-minute promotional reel were made. [24] [25] [26] \n In October 2019, it was reported that Marvel Studios' president Kevin Feige had been promoted to become Marvel Chief Creative Officer. Under this structure,  Marvel Television  and Marvel Family Entertainment will be moving under Marvel Studios, with  Marvel Entertainment  president reporting to Feige.  [27] \n \n Licensing films \n The first film packaged and licensed by Marvel Studios was  Blade , based on the vampire hunter  Blade . The film was directed by  Stephen Norrington  and starred  Wesley Snipes  as Blade. It was released on August 21, 1998, grossing $70,087,718 in the United States and Canada and $131,183,530 worldwide. [28]  \n Blade  was followed by  X-Men , which was directed by  Bryan Singer  and was released on July 14, 2000.  X-Men  grossed $157,299,717 in the United States and Canada and $296,250,053 worldwide. [29]   Blade  and  X-Men  demonstrated that widely popular films could be made out of comic book characters not familiar to the general public. [30] \n Leading up to  X-Men ' s release, Marvel Studios negotiated a deal with then-functional  Artisan Entertainment , successful with the low-budget  The Blair Witch Project , for a co-production joint venture that included rights to 15 Marvel characters including  Captain America ,  Thor ,  Black Panther ,  Iron Fist , and  Deadpool . Artisan would finance and distribute while Marvel would develop licensing and merchandising tie-ins. The resulting production library, which would also include TV series, direct-to-video films and internet projects, would be co-owned. [31]  By 2001, the success of Marvel Entertainment's  Ultimate Marvel  imprint comics created leverage in Hollywood for Marvel Studios, pushing more properties into development. [32] \n The next film licensed from Marvel Studios was  Spider-Man  by  Columbia Pictures , directed by  Sam Raimi  and starring  Tobey Maguire  as Spider-Man. The film was released on May 3, 2002, grossing $403,706,375 in the United States and Canada and $821,708,551 worldwide. [33]  The early success of  Spider-Man  led the film's studio to issue a seven-figure advance for a sequel. Arad spoke of the deal, \"Movies make sequels. Therefore, it's a big economic luxury to know that a movie's going to get a second and third. This is a business of precedence.\" [34]  According to a Lehman Brothers analysis, the Studios made only $62 million for the first 2 Spider-Man movies. [35]  Marvel was making more from half the consumer product licensing fees while making relatively little from the movie, but was enough for Marvel to regain its financial footings. [36]  In October 2002, Marvel Studios announced deals for Sub-Mariner and  Prime  with  Universal Studios . [37] \n In contrast to the original storylines of DC Comics' Superman and Batman films, Marvel films were more directly inspired by their comics, copying from them set pieces, scenes, plots, and dialogue. [30] \n In 2003,  David Maisel  approached Arad about earning Marvel more for their films. Maisel, Arad and Perlmutter met leading to Maisel being hired as President and COO. The studio's office, then on Santa Monica Boulevard, was small with a dozen or so staff members.  Kevin Feige , later to become CEO, was then a junior executive generating script notes to the licensed studios. [36]  In January 2003, Marvel, The SCI FI Channel and  Reveille Productions  agreed to develop two pilot films based on  Brother Voodoo  and  Strikeforce: Morituri . [38] \n Partnering with  Lionsgate  in 2004, Marvel Studios planned to enter the direct-to-DVD market with  eight animated films  with  Lionsgate Home Entertainment  handling distribution. [39] [40]  The line was a proof of concept for Maisel's later plan. [36]  Eric Rollman was hired by Marvel as Executive Vice President, Home Entertainment & TV Production for Marvel Studios to oversee the deal with Lionsgate. [41] \n \n Production \n In 2004, David Maisel was hired as chief operating officer of Marvel Studios as he had a plan for the studio to self-finance movies. [42]  Marvel entered into a  non-recourse debt  structure with  Merrill Lynch  that was collateralized by certain movie rights to a total of 10 characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel got $525\u00a0million to make a maximum of 10 movies based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the original deal. Those characters were:  Ant-Man ,  The Avengers ,  Black Panther ,  Captain America ,  Cloak & Dagger ,  Doctor Strange ,  Hawkeye ,  Nick Fury ,  Power Pack  and  Shang-Chi . [43]   Ambac  insured the movies would succeed or they would pay the interest payment on the debt and get the movie rights collateral. [35] \n Initially Marvel Studios was in talks with Universal Pictures as a possible distributor, as Universal owned the film rights to both  Hulk  and  Namor [44] [45]  during that time. Negotiations dragged on, so the studio began talks with  Paramount Pictures . In the second quarter of 2005, Merrill attempted to back out of full financing of each movie, demanding that Marvel finance 1/3 of the budget. Marvel took back rights in five foreign territories from Paramount for pre-sell to meet that demand. [36]  On September 6, 2005, Marvel announced the Merrill Lynch financing deal with Paramount was on as marketer and distributor. Also, the parent company changed its name from Marvel Enterprises, Inc. to Marvel Entertainment, Inc. to reflect the change to self-production. [43] \n The studio moved to a new location over a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Beverly Hills. Maisel was also named vice-chairman of the studio, but reported to  Isaac Perlmutter . [36]  In October 2005, Michael Helfant joined the studio as president and chief operating officer. [46] \n In November 2005, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man from  New Line Cinema . Marvel revealed that it had regained the film rights to Hulk from Universal in February 2006, [47]  in exchange for letting Universal own the distribution rights to  The Incredible Hulk  and the right of first refusal to pick up the distribution rights to any future Marvel Studios-produced  Hulk  films. [48]  In April 2006, Thor was announced to be a Marvel Studios production. [49]  Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped the  Black Widow  motion picture project it had since 2004 giving the rights back to Marvel. [50] \n Maisel and Arad fought over the rate of movie releases and strength of characters in the movie line up. Perlmutter supported Maisel and thus, in May 2006, Arad quit as studio chair and CEO. [42]  In March 2007, David Maisel was named Chairman and Kevin Feige was named President of Production as  Iron Man  began filming. [51] \n In January 2008,  Marvel Animation  was incorporated to direct Marvel's efforts in animation and home entertainment markets including then animation efforts with Lionsgate and  Nickelodeon . [41]  The company in March agreed to a five picture basic cable distribution with  FX  for Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk movies with the additional movies to be named later. [52]  In November, Marvel Studios signed a lease with  Raleigh Studios  to host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four movies on the studios' slate, including  Iron Man 2  and  Thor , at their Manhattan Beach facilities. [53]  By September 2008, Paramount added to its domestic film distribution contract 5 additional Marvel movies' foreign distribution. [54] \n In 2009, Marvel attempted to hire a team of writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther,  Cable , Iron Fist,  Nighthawk , and  Vision . [55]  In early 2009,  Sony  returned all Spider-Man television rights (including live action) in exchange for an adjustment to the movie rights. [56] \n \n Disney conglomerate subsidiary (2009\u2013present) \n    Former typeface logo (2013\u20132016) \n On December 31, 2009,  The Walt Disney Company  purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4\u00a0billion. Both Marvel and Disney stated that the merger would not affect any preexisting deals with other film studios for the time being, [57]  although Disney said they would distribute future Marvel projects with their own  studio  once the deals expired. [58] \n In April 2010, rumors circulated that Marvel was looking to create $20\u201340 million movies based on properties such as Doctor Strange,  Ka-Zar , Luke Cage,  Dazzler , and Power Pack. [59]  Kevin Feige responded by saying, while budgets are generally never discussed early in development, Marvel was considering films for all characters mentioned in the rumor, except Dazzler, whose rights were at Fox. [60] \n In June 2010, Marvel Entertainment set up a  television division  within Marvel Studios, headed up by  Jeph Loeb  as Executive Vice President, [61]  under which Marvel Animation would be operated. [62]  On October 18,  Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures  acquired the distribution rights for  The Avengers  and  Iron Man 3  from Paramount Pictures [63]  with Paramount's logo and credit remaining on the films. [64] \n On August 22, 2011, at Disney's behest, the Studio dismissed most of its marketing department: Dana Precious, EVP of Worldwide Marketing; Jeffrey Stewart, VP of Worldwide Marketing and Jodi Miller, Manager of Worldwide Marketing. Disney markets Marvel's films. [65]  In April 2012, The Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios and  DMG Entertainment  announced an agreement to co-produce  Iron Man 3  in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney. [66] \n In April 2013, Marvel Studios moved its executive production offices from  Manhattan Beach  Studios Media Campus to  The Walt Disney Studios  in  Burbank, California . [67] \n On July 2, 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to  Iron Man ,  Iron Man 2 ,  Thor  and  Captain America: The First Avenger  from Paramount. [68] [69]  In September 2014,  TNT  acquired the cable rights for  Avengers: Age of Ultron ,  Captain America: Civil War , and three other films, to air on the network two years after their theatrical releases. The films had previously aired on FX since 2008. [70] \n \n Disney Studios subsidiary \nIn August 2015, Marvel Studios was placed into Walt Disney Studios, with Feige reporting directly to Walt Disney Studios chairman  Alan Horn  instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Marvel Television and subsidiary Marvel Animation were left under Marvel Entertainment and Perlmutter's control. [71] [72]   Fast Company  ranked Marvel Studios number eleven on its 2018 World's Most Innovative Companies list. [73]      The Frank G. Wells Building, the studio's home as of April 2017 [74] [75]  As of April 2017, Marvel Studios was housed on the second floor of the Frank G. Wells Building at the Disney studio lot. [74] [75] \n In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series for the streaming service  Disney+ , to be centered on \"second tier\" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Characters being considered for series included  Loki  and  Scarlet Witch , with the actors who portrayed the characters in the films expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, with a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio productions\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development. [76]  In October 2019, Marvel Studios President  Kevin Feige  was given the title of Chief Creative Officer, Marvel, and will oversee the creative direction of Marvel Television and Marvel Family Entertainment (animation), with both being returned to being under the Marvel Studios banner. [77] \n \n Character rights \n Marvel had licensed out the film rights to many of their characters to other studios in the 1990s, starting with the  X-Men [17] ,  Fantastic Four ,  Spider-Man ,  Daredevil  and later  Iron Man ,  Thor ,  Hulk ,  Black Widow ,  Luke Cage ,  Punisher ,  Blade ,  Ghost Rider ,  Man-Thing ,  Black Panther  and  Deadpool  among others.\n In February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in  Captain America: Civil War  and Sony releasing  Spider-Man: Homecoming  produced by Feige and Pascal on July 7, 2017. As part of the deal, Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films. [78]  In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal did not allow Spider-Man to appear in any of the  MCU television series , as it was \"very specific... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed.\" [79] \n In September 2019, it was announced that Disney and Sony had reached a new agreement allowing for Spider-Man to appear in a third standalone film (produced by Marvel Studios and Feige) and a future Marvel Studios film. [80]  Disney was reported to be co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of the film's profits in the new agreement, while retaining the merchandising rights to the character.

[90]  However, Feige expanded in July 2014 saying that Marvel Studios, not Universal Pictures or  Legendary Pictures , could make a Namor film, \"but it's slightly more complicated than that. Let's put it this way \u2013 there are entanglements that make it less easy. There are older contracts that still involve other parties that mean we need to work things out before we move forward on it. As opposed to an Iron Man or any of the Avengers or any of the other Marvel characters where we could just put them in.\" [91]  In June 2016, Quesada again stated that, to his knowledge, the film rights to Namor had returned to Marvel. [92]  In October 2018, Feige noted the character could appear in the MCU, with the studio still deciding how it would use the character. [93] \n \n \n Ego, the Living Planet\n \n 2016\n \n 20th Century Fox\n \n 20th Century Fox was able to change the powers of  Negasonic Teenage Warhead  for  Deadpool  by giving Marvel Studios the rights to  Ego the Living Planet , who appears in  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 . [94] \n \n\n \n Fantastic Four\n \n 2019\n \n 20th Century Fox/ Constantin Film \n \n In 1986, Constantin Film originally licensed the film rights of the  Fantastic Four  from Marvel [95]  and produced an  unreleased low-budget film  in 1992 with  Roger Corman 's  New Horizon Studios  to  renew the license . Marvel paid in exchange for the film's negative so Constantin could sub-license the rights to 20th Century Fox. On December 14, 2017, Disney  agreed to purchase  20th Century Fox's parent company  21st Century Fox , after it spins off some of its businesses. [96]  The deal was completed on March 20, 2019.

The company was incorporated on September 9, 2005  [105]  and announced as a label for releasing music related to Marvel's film and television productions in 2009. [106]  According to the company, Marvel Music has released albums in conjunction with Disney's  Hollywood Records . [107] \n In 2014,  Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1  became  certified Gold \u2014and subsequently  certified Platinum \u2014by the  Recording Industry Association of America . It also became the first  soundtrack album  in history to top the  Billboard  200  chart while consisting entirely of previously released songs. [108] \n \n Logo \n Play media    Logo animation (2013\u20132016), featuring the first Marvel Studios fanfare (0:28). \n Starting with the release of  Spider-Man  in 2002, Marvel Studios introduced its \"flipbook\"  production logo , created by Imaginary Forces. [109]  This logo was accompanied with music from the film's score, sound effects or a song, to lead into the beginning of the film. This was the logo seen in front of all films until 2013, when the logo was updated with the release of  Thor: The Dark World , again created by Imaginary Forces. Kevin Feige stated that since Marvel was now their own entity within The Walt Disney Company, it \"felt like the time to update it and have something that is more substantial as a standalone logo in front of our features\" instead of having it be accompanied by Marvel's studio or distribution partners' logos. Feige added that \"We didn't want to re-invent the wheel [with the new logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it's more dimensional as we go through the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios at the bottom of the word Marvel.\" [110]  Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002. They were given a few hundred comic books to select images from, ultimately choosing 120 that were \"universal and not specific to one character\" and created a narrative \"where each image spoke to the one before it and after.\" [109] \n The new logo appeared on all subsequent studio productions set within the  Marvel Cinematic Universe  through  Captain America: Civil War . With the addition of the new logo, Marvel Studios also added a fanfare to accompany the logo, composed by  Brian Tyler , who wrote the scores to  Iron Man 3 ,  Thor: The Dark World , and  Avengers: Age of Ultron . [110]  It was featured on the films  Thor: The Dark World ,  Captain America: The Winter Soldier , and  Guardians of the Galaxy .\n In July 2016, another new logo and opening were introduced, featuring an updated fanfare, composed this time by  Doctor Strange  and  Spider-Man: Homecoming  composer  Michael Giacchino . The new opening begins with comic book panels seen in the previous two openings, but transitions into footage and art of the characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. [111]  It was first seen in front of  Doctor Strange . [112]  The updated logo was created by Perception, who were first approached in January 2016 by Marvel to update their logo. Feige specifically requested Perception \"to combine the brand and the iconic characters into a single image, showcasing the heroes within the letterforms of the Marvel logo.\" The Perception team settled on a concept they dubbed \"How to Build a Universe\", which \"was designed to pay tribute to [the film making] process by touching on\" how a film's origins is inspired by the comics, which then results in a script, followed by concept art, resulting in the final film. Perception looked to the initial \"flipbook\" logo for inspiration, and paid tribute to it in the new opening, as it opens identically to the flipbook logo. Next, the opening includes \"various lines lifted directly from the script pages of various Marvel screenplays\", with Perception picking \"both iconic fan-favorites, as well as lines that helped establish the breadth of the Marvel Universe.\" To add in the concept art images, Perception looked \"through a massive archive of concept art and \"The Art Of\u2026\" books, to select the most iconic images for each beloved character. Utilizing the original digital paintings themselves, the Perception team animated each image being painted from scratch. The final touch was mapping this artwork onto 3D models to giving these once 2D paintings a sense of depth as the camera moves around them.\" Finally, over 70 pieces of footage from the 13 films that had released at that time were included, with Perception arranging them in a way they called the \"vault\" \"where luminescent footage plays on the interior walls of the \"Marvel\" logotype.\" [113] \n A modified version of Perception's logo was introduced at the 2017  D23  Expo to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the MCU. [114]  The logo debuted with  Avengers: Infinity War  on April 26, 2018 and was used again in  Ant-Man and the Wasp . With the release of  Captain Marvel , the current Perception logo was altered at Marvel Studios' behest in honor of  Stan Lee ; Lee died on November 12, 2018, just a few months before the release of the film. [115]  The logo was altered, replacing the characters with  Stan Lee \u2019s MCU cameos, accompanied by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". [116]  The Perception logo underwent a slight alteration again with the release of  Avengers: Endgame . The Marvel Studios fanfare was not used during the intro, but rather the song  Dear Mr. Fantasy  by the English rock band  Traffic . The clips from preceding films shown during the intro sequence were also slightly changed to reflect the events of  Avengers: Infinity War , only showing characters and clips from films featuring the Avengers who survived Thanos' Decimation at the end of the aforementioned film.

It is regarded as a dominant and influential company in the talent agency business and manages numerous clients. [1] [2]  In March 2016, CAA had 1,800 employees. [3] \n \n    To expand, CAA borrowed capital from  private equity firm  TPG Capital. TPG owns 35% of CAA, according to one estimate in 2014.

[4]  At a dinner,  Mike Rosenfeld ,  Michael Ovitz ,  Ron Meyer , William Haber, and Rowland Perkins decided to create their own agency. The agents were fired by William Morris before they could obtain financing. [5] [6]  CAA was  incorporated in Delaware  and had a $35,000 line of credit and a $21,000 bank loan and rented a small Century City office. Within a week, they sold a  game show  called  Rhyme and Reason , the  Rich Little  Show , and  The Jackson 5ive . An early plan was to form a medium-sized full-service agency, share proceeds equally, and do without nameplates on doors or formal titles or individual client lists, with guidelines like \"be a team player\" and \"return phone calls promptly.\"\n CAA used its writer clients to attract actors to the agency. Ovitz and CAA were the first to  package  films like TV shows. Representing numerous A-list actors and having about $90 million in annual bookings in the late 1970s, Ovitz led the agency to expand into the film business. [5] [6]  By the mid-1990s, CAA had 550 employees, about 1,400 of Hollywood's top talent, and $150 million in revenue. [7]  In the 1990s, CAA was owned mostly by several key agents, including Michael Ovitz, Bill Haber, and Ron Meyer. [1] \n Ovitz was good at at \"packaging talent for movies and TV projects\" and negotiating large deals between Japanese conglomerates, such as Sony and Matsushita, with Hollywood studios, such as Columbia/TriStar and MCA. [8]  Ovitz expanded the agency into advertising and telecommunications. [8]  In 1992, the  Coca-Cola  company placed CAA in charge of much of its marketing campaign, to work alongside advertising agency  McCann Erickson . [9]  In 1995, CAA was described as the industry's most powerful agency. [1] \n In the middle 1990s, however, there were major changes in management. In 1995, Ron Meyer was appointed as the head of  MCA , [1]  and Ovitz left for  Disney . The departure of Ovitz and Meyer brought an exodus of some of CAA's top-marquee names. Talent agent  Jay Moloney  was originally part of the transition but due to his drug addiction, he was fired and later committed suicide. [10]  After Ovitz, the agency was taken over by Richard Lovett, who was made the president, along with Kevin Huvane, Rob Light,  Bryan Lourd , Rick Nicita, and David O\u2019Connor as managing partners. [11]  \n In 1996, several CAA agents defected to rival agency William Morris Endeavor, taking with them prominent directors and actors. [12]  The partners founded the  CAA Foundation  in 1996 to create positive social change by encouraging  volunteerism , partnerships, and donations. In 2012, it worked with  Insight Labs  for education reform, and contributed to its  School Is Not School  reform effort. [13] \n CAA established CAA Marketing in 1998 to work with brands and clients for promotion purposes. [14] [15]  CAA Marketing developed  Chipotle's   Back to the Start  video. [16]  and created a marketing campaign for  Coca-Cola [4] \n In 2003, it opened a New York City office to manage theater clients. [17] [18]  CAA began expanding into sports in 2006. [3] [11]  From 2005 to 2015, CAA developed greater fiscal discipline, with more emphasis on profits, possibly as the result of the influence of private equity firms. [19]  During these years, CAA doubled in size, from 750 to 1,500 employees. [4]  In 2010, new technological developments such as the digital distribution of movies put strains on the industry. [20]  There was pressure to diversify into television, publishing, concerts, and find other ways to grow. [20]  In that year, private equity firm  TPG Capital  invested $165 million with an additional $200 million in debt financing. [20] \n CAA began an expansion into sports in 2006, under the leadership of CEO Richard Lovett. [3] [11]  A report in  USA Today  suggested that CAA's development of its sports-related clientele was significant in 2007. [21]  A report in  Nexus  magazine in 2015 suggested that CAA was well-positioned to develop the E-Sports market. [22]  CAA puts together deals for sports stars such as writing their clients into fitness apps. [23] \n CAA's agents scrambled to deal with a strike by the  Screen Actors Guild  in 2008. [24] \n In 2010, TPG Capital gained a 35% interest in the agency and pledged $500 million for investments. [25]  The transaction enabled acquisitions in areas such as sports and overseas operations. [26]  It later sold a controlling stake to TPG Capital in October 2014. [27]  In 2015, TPG Capital was reported to own 53% of CAA. [22]  CAA is co-owner with an investment bank. [3]  CAA has diversified into different businesses such as sports marketers and leagues and digital commerce. [4]  In 2014, CAA has been undergoing a transformation from relying solely on booking talent, into engineering multimedia deals worldwide. [4]  To this end, CAA established CAA Ventures, a venture capital fund that has supported products such as the  Whisper  app. [28] \n \n Agents [ edit ] \n    The departure of comedy star  Will Ferrell  led to major legal battling. \n CAA has employed top sports agents such as  Tom Condon . [29] \n CAA president Richard Lovett is regarded as shunning media attention and keeping a low profile. [3]  Lovett took the job position at CAA in 1995, and he was described as a \"skillful agent\" with a \"trademark ever-ready smile\" adept at schmoozing and hobnobbing with colleagues and studio heads. [30]  Lovett was described in  The Wall Street Journal  as being \"elegantly aggressive.\" [3] \n Top agencies frequently raid each other's staff, and when key people defect to rivals, it makes news headlines and often leads to legal battles over breach-of-contract claims. [31]  When agents defect, the rivalry can degenerate quickly into vicious battles played out in courtrooms and in the media. When key CAA clients  Will Ferrell  and  Chris Pratt  defected to rival  United Talent Agency  (UTA) in 2015, and were later followed by ten agents, it erupted into a full-frontal legal battle between the warring agencies. [32]  In the lawsuit, CAA accused UTA of conducting a \"lawless, midnight raid\" as part of a \"illegal and unethical conspiracy\" with agents deliberately delaying meetings with clients to divert business to UTA. [32]  In a bitter lawsuit and countersuit between CAA and UTA in 2015, which began after a slew of CAA's agents departed for UTA, there were accusations of fraud, malicious untruths, lying, and a range of charges including a \"breach of duty of loyalty\" as well as \"conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty.\" [33] \n Rivalry is not limited to rank-and-file agents, but can take the form of public barbs by company CEOs. [34]  Grudges can last for years; for example, movie producer  Jay Weston  sued CAA in 1979 about the rights to a film, and years later, it was revealed that Weston was \"totally ostracized\" by the agency. In effect, CAA would do the minimally required legal tasks of passing along required offers but otherwise staying uninvolved. [35] \n \n    Courtney Love  contends that she was blacklisted since 2005 by CAA for making a comment about now-disgraced producer  Harvey Weinstein . [36] [37] \n Some agents have had a reputation in the public's mind of living in a world of \"fast cars, rooftop bars and foul-mouthed, phone-throwing power brokers,\" according to an account in the  Los Angeles Times . [19]  CAA agent Jay Moloney led a colorful yet self-destructive life. Moloney interned at CAA while studying at  USC , became the right-hand man of Michael Ovitz, worked with clients such as  Leonardo DiCaprio  and made millions, dated actresses such as  Jennifer Grey  and  Gina Gershon , and \"battled personal demons\" and became a \"slave to cocaine\"; Moloney committed suicide at age 35. [38]  In 2004 the HBO production entitled  Entourage  was made about a fictional Hollywood agent named Ari Gold. [39]  According to one report, the fictional Ari Gold character may have been based on a hybrid between an \"even-keeled\" Creative Artists Agency agent named Jeff Jacobs and an \"abrasive 'go-for-the-jugular'\" William Morris Endeavor agent named  Ari Emanuel . [39]  The report suggested that images like these may contribute to the public perception of agents as foul-mouthed and aggressive bullies. [39]  Perhaps because of its dominance in the industry, CAA agents have a reputation for being \"coldhearted Hollywood power brokers,\" according to one report in  The Wall Street Journal . [4]  The agency has been accused of blacklisting people who did or said things that the agency did not want publicized; for example,  Courtney Love  said that she was \"eternally banned\" beginning 2005 by CAA after making a negative comment about Miramax producer  Harvey Weinstein . [36]  Uma Thurman left CAA on November 22, 2017, the day before making an Instagram post addressing accusations against Harvey Weinstein. [40] \n \n The talent agency business [ edit ] \n With many clients, agents charge a percentage fee based on monies that their clients make; one estimate was that CAA charges 10% of what its movie and television clients are paid. [4] \n CAA chiefs including Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer and Bill Haber built the agency by packaging actors and directors with literary clients, [12]  but the scope of deal-making has widened in recent decades. For example, CAA crafted a deal between toy-maker Hasbro and  DreamWorks  and  Paramount Pictures , along with numerous CAA writers and directors, to make the movie franchise  Transformers . [11] [41]  Sometimes deal-making entails creating new technology firms. [3]  CAA even manages deals with the estates of long-dead clients such as reggae musician  Bob Marley , who died in 1981. [42]  CAA helped one former politician create an online career institute. [43]  CAA sold sponsorship rights for a baseball stadium in San Francisco. [4] \n While talent agencies can grow by making acquisitions, CAA has generally grown organically by bringing in new clients. [4]  The company divided its agents into two camps: traditional agents who manage the career tracks of 1,000 stars, and specialists in  investment banking , consulting, advertising and digital media. The agency can use its more glamorous clients in film and TV to craft deals with steadier income streams; for example, using clients such as  Julia Roberts , they can assemble marketing programs for less glamorous clients, [4]  such as  Nationwide Insurance . [44] \n When Hollywood agents change firms, and take stars and talent with them, it can have major financial repercussions for the departing agency, [12]  and can lead to much confusion as lawyers pour over the fine print of numerous contracts.\n \n    A CAA-catered party after the 2013  Sundance Film Festival  got a bit \"bawdy\" and lewd, prompting a public relations backlash. [45] \n To market themselves, talent agencies often cater exclusive parties following awards ceremonies such as the  Golden Globes . [46]  In 2013 CAA threw a party at the  Sundance Film Festival  which caused embarrassment and a public relations backlash, where \"guests mingled with lingerie-clad women pretending to snort prop cocaine, erotic dancers outfitted with sex toys and an Alice in Wonderland look-alike performing a simulated sex act on a man in a rabbit costume.\" [45] \n \n Buildings [ edit ] \n In the late 1980s, CAA commissioned architect  I. M. Pei  to design a new headquarters building at the corner of  Santa Monica  and  Wilshire Boulevards  in  Beverly Hills . The 75,000-square-foot (7,000\u00a0m 2 ), three-story building consists of two curved wings set around a central  atrium  with a  skylight  that rises into a conical glass tower. [47]  The 57-foot (17\u00a0m) high atrium was designed as an art-filled formal reception hall with a 100-seat screening room and gourmet kitchen and displays a 27-foot (8.2\u00a0m) by 18-foot (5.5\u00a0m)  mural  by  Roy Lichtenstein . The design used  feng shui  principles. [48]  In 2007, CAA relocated to a new building in  Century City , a district of  Los Angeles . [48]  The new headquarters are sometimes referred to as \"The  Death Star \" by entertainment professionals. [4]  CAA has offices in  Los Angeles ,  New York ,  Nashville ,  London ,  Beijing ,  Atlanta ,  Miami ,  Chicago ,  Memphis ,  Dallas ,  Stockholm ,  Munich  and  Switzerland .\n \n Competition [ edit ] \n CAA was formed in 1975 from defections from the William Morris Agency, and there continue to be about four or five major talent agencies.\n In 2009, William Morris Agency and Endeavor merged to form  William Morris Endeavor  (WME). As of 2015, CAA and WME are the largest agencies in the business. [20] [22]  In 2014 WME bought IMG Worldwide, a fashion and sports agency, for $2.4 billion. [4]  In 2014, WME had 4500 employees while CAA had 1500 employees. [4]  WME had a larger share of sports-related clients. [4]  The rivalry can get cantankerous: in one instance, the William Morris Endeavor agency placed dozens of ads around the city using Creative Artists Agency's red-and-white color signature with the headline being CAAN'T, a \"playful nod to the CAA acronym.\" [4] [49]  The agencies compete by \"regularly poaching agents and clients from one another.\" [4] \n \n In popular culture [ edit ] \n In Jay McInerney's short story \"The Business\" from  How It Ended , the main character is a screenwriter represented by CAA. CAA's building is featured in the video game  Midnight Club: Los Angeles .\n \n Clients [ edit ] \n Further information:  List of Creative Artists Agency clients \n Controversies [ edit ] \n    There were reports that the agency was complicit in covering up the sexual harassment of women by  Harvey Weinstein . [50] \n    Actress  Uma Thurman  accused CAA of helping disgraced producer  Harvey Weinstein  in his predatory behavior. [51] \n In December 2017 there were reports that the agency was actively involved in coverups relating to abuse and harassment by disgraced Miramax executive  Harvey Weinstein . [52]   Variety , citing a report in  The New York Times , reported that at least eight agents knew about the ongoing harassment yet continued to do business with Weinstein, and even sent actresses to meet with him in situations where they might have been vulnerable to his predations. [52] [50]  Actress  Uma Thurman  accused the agency of being connected to Weinstein's predatory behavior.

Created by writer  Roy Thomas  and artist  Gene Colan , Danvers first appeared as an  officer  in the  United States Air Force  and a colleague of the  Kree  superhero  Mar-Vell  in  Marvel Super-Heroes  #13 (March 1968). Danvers later became the first incarnation of  Ms. Marvel  in  Ms. Marvel  #1 ( cover-dated  Jan. 1977) after her  DNA  was fused with Mar-Vell's during an explosion, giving her superhuman powers. Debuting in the  Silver Age  of comics, the character was featured in a self-titled series in the late 1970s before becoming associated with the superhero teams the  Avengers  and the  X-Men . The character has also been known as  Binary ,  Warbird  and  Captain Marvel  at various points in her history. Danvers has been labeled \"Marvel's biggest female hero\" [2]  and \"quite possibly Marvel's mightiest Avenger\". [3] [4]   In 2012, Danvers' incarnation of Ms Marvel was the highest ranked female character (at #11) on  IGN 's list of the \"Top 50 Avengers\".\n Carol Danvers has been featured in other Marvel licensed products including  video games ,  animated   television series , and merchandise such as  trading cards .  Brie Larson  portrays the character in the  Marvel Cinematic Universe  in the films  Captain Marvel  (2019) and  Avengers: Endgame  (2019).\n \n Contents \n \n 1   Publication history \n \n 1.1   1960s \n 1.2   1970s \n 1.3   1980s \n 1.4   1990s \n 1.5   2000s \n 1.6   2010s \n \n \n 2   Characterization \n 3   Powers and abilities \n 4   Other versions \n \n 4.1   \"Age of Apocalypse\" \n 4.2   \"Age of Ultron\" \n 4.3   Amalgam \n 4.4   Exiles \n 4.5   Marvel Mangaverse \n 4.6   Ultimate Marvel \n 4.7   Infinity Warps \n 4.8   X-Men: The End \n 4.9   Universe X \n 4.10   Deadpool kills Deadpool \n 4.11   Age of Sentry \n 4.12   Infinity Countdown \n 4.13   What If? \n 4.14   Marvel Universe vs The Punisher \n 4.15   Venomverse: War Stories \n \n \n 5   In other media \n \n 5.1   Television \n 5.2   Film \n 5.3   Novels \n 5.4   Theatre \n 5.5   Video games \n \n \n 6   Collected editions \n 7   See also \n 8   References \n 9   External links \n \n \n\n Publication history [ edit ] \n 1960s [ edit ] \n    First appearance of Carol Danvers in  Marvel Super-Heroes  #13 (March 1968). Art by  Gene Colan .  \n The character debuted in  Marvel Super-Heroes  #13 (March 1968) by writer  Roy Thomas  and artist  Gene Colan . In the story, she is an  officer  in the  United States Air Force  and Security Chief of a restricted military base, where Danvers meets Dr. Walter Lawson, the human  alias  of  alien   Kree  hero  Captain Marvel . [5]  In a later story, Danvers is caught in the explosion of a Kree device after trying to get close to Captain Marvel. [6]  Although Captain Marvel manages to save her life, Danvers sustains serious injuries. [7] \n \n 1970s [ edit ] \n    Carol Danvers as  Ms. Marvel  on the cover of  Ms. Marvel  #1 (Jan. 1977). Art by  John Romita, Sr. \n Danvers resurfaces with superhuman abilities and becomes the hero  Ms. Marvel  (created by writer  Gerry Conway  and artist  John Buscema ) in a self-titled series in January 1977, at first written by  Gerry Conway  and later by  Chris Claremont . In the series, it is revealed that the energy exposure from the explosion of a device called the \"Psyche-Magnetron\" caused Danvers's genetic structure to meld with Captain Marvel's, effectively turning her into a human-Kree hybrid. [8]  Ms. Marvel had a series of semi-regular appearances in  The Avengers , with additional appearances with the Defenders, [9]   Spider-Man , [10]  the  Thing , [11]  and  Iron Man . [12]  In one of these stories, the mutant terrorist  Mystique  kills Michael Barnett, Ms. Marvel's lover. [13] \n At the time of the publication of  Ms. Marvel  #1 in 1977, the title was self-consciously socially progressive for its time. This was reflected in the use of the word \" Ms. \", then associated with the  feminist movement , [2]  and in Danvers fighting for  equal pay for equal work  in her civilian identity. [14] \n \n 1980s [ edit ] \n    Cover to  Uncanny X-Men  #164 (Dec. 1982). Carol Danvers's first appearance as Binary. Art by  Dave Cockrum . \n In  The Avengers  #200 (Oct. 1980), which was written by  Bob Layton ,  David Michelinie ,  George P\u00e9rez , and  Jim Shooter , Ms. Marvel is kidnapped by a character named Marcus (the apparent son of Avengers foe  Immortus ) and taken to an  alternate dimension , where she is brainwashed, raped, and impregnated. She gives birth on Earth to a child that rapidly ages into another version of Marcus, who is ultimately unable to remain on Earth after  Hawkeye  mistakenly damages his machine and takes Ms. Marvel back to the alternate dimension with no opposition from the Avengers, who perceive Ms. Marvel and Marcus to have fallen in love. Comic book historian  Carol A. Strickland  criticized the storyline in an essay titled \"The Rape of Ms. Marvel\". [15]  Citing Marcus' line, \"Finally, after relative weeks of such efforts\u2014and admittedly, with a subtle boost from Immortus' machines\u2014you became mine\", Strickland posited that this constituted rape. As a former writer of the solo title, Chris Claremont also commented on the inappropriateness of the storyline. [16] \n Claremont wrote a follow up to the Marcus story in  Avengers Annual  #10 (1981). In that story, Danvers is revealed to have returned to Earth\u2014courtesy of Immortus's technology after Marcus continued to age and die of old age\u2014but is attacked by the mutant  Rogue , who permanently absorbs the character's abilities and memories. Danvers' memories are restored by  Professor X , and an angry confrontation with the Avengers concerning their failure to realize Marcus had brainwashed her follows. [17]  Claremont continued to develop the character in the title  Uncanny X-Men . Danvers enters  the Pentagon  and, while wiping the government's files on the  X-Men , also deletes all records of herself in a symbolic break with her life as Ms. Marvel. [18]  During an adventure in space with the X-Men, Danvers is changed courtesy of experimentation by the alien race, the  Brood , into a newly-empowered character called Binary (created by writer Chris Claremont and artist  Dave Cockrum ). [19]  Drawing on the power of a cosmic phenomenon called a  white hole , Danvers becomes capable of generating the power of a star. As Binary, the character has a number of encounters with the X-Men, [20]  the  New Mutants , [21]  and the British team,  Excalibur , [22]  as well as a solo adventure. [23] \n Claremont expanded on the incident with the character Rogue by having the Carol-Danvers persona manifest itself within Rogue's mind, sometimes overpowering Rogue's personality. This happens to Rogue on several occasions, which results in an uneasy armistice between the personalities within Rogue's mind. [24] [25]  After Rogue passes through the ancient, supernatural gateway called the  Siege Perilous , the Ms.-Marvel persona is separated from her as an independent entity. Within the same issue, the Ms.Marvel persona is killed by  Magneto . [26] \n \n 1990s [ edit ] \n Carol Danvers continued to make sporadic appearances, [27]  and two additional issues planned for the original title\u2014prevented by cancellation\u2014were printed in a quarterly anthology series. [28]  That same year she appeared extensively in the storyline \" Operation Galactic Storm \". By the conclusion of the story, she lost her connection to the white hole she drew her powers from, reverting to her original Ms. Marvel powers. She did retain the energy manipulation and absorption powers she had as Binary, but on a smaller scale. [29] \n After several more team and solo appearances [30]  she rejoins the Avengers [31]  with the new alias Warbird (created by writer  Kurt Busiek  and artist  George P\u00e9rez ). Busiek explored the character by having her develop  alcoholism , struggling to come to terms with the loss of her cosmic powers and memories. Danvers disgraces herself during the \"Live Kree or Die\" storyline [32]  and is soon suspended from active duty. [33] \n After a brief appearance in Marvel's  alternate universe  title  What If? , [34]  the character was featured in  Iron Man , [35]   Wolverine , [36]  and  The Avengers [37]  before making a cameo appearance in  Mutant X . [38] \n \n 2000s [ edit ] \n    Carol Danvers as Ms. Marvel on the cover of  Ms. Marvel  vol. 2, #1 (March 2006). Art by  Frank Cho . \n As Warbird, the character returns to the Avengers and plays a key role in the \" Kang Dynasty \" plotline. [39]   Kang 's son Marcus, the  Scarlet Centurion , falls in love with her, but she rejects him, in part because he reminds her of Marcus, son of Kang's older alter ego Immortus, who raped her. The Scarlet Centurion nonetheless helps her to defeat the  Master of the World , a supervillain whose alien technology becomes the key to defeating Kang. In the course of the fight, Warbird kills the Master, and after the final victory over Kang she demands a court martial to review her actions. The court martial finds her killing justified as an act of war, and Carol continues as an Avenger. After the  Avengers disband , Warbird leaves the group, and, along with other prominent former Avengers like  Wasp ,  Hank Pym ,  Falcon  and  Wonder Man , is not included in the  New Avengers  group soon formed by  Iron Man  and  Captain America . [40] \n The character was then featured as \"Captain Marvel\" in a false reality created by the mutant  Scarlet Witch  in the 2005 miniseries  House of M . [41]  In this reality, Danvers' had glimpsed at her potential, becoming its greatest hero. After seeing how great of a hero she can really be, she decided to fulfill her potential in the main Marvel universe. [42] [43]  Together with fellow Avenger Iron Man, Danvers also becomes a principal advocate of the  Superhuman Registration Act  during the events of the 2006\u201307 \" Civil War \" storyline. [44]  The story also continues in Ms. Marvel's own title as the character battles the anti-registration heroes led by Captain America. [45] \n The storyline has major consequences for the  New Avengers , which debuts in the 2007 series  The Mighty Avengers , with Danvers as a member. [46]  Danvers enters into a relationship with fellow member  Wonder Man , [47]  appears in a  crossover  series with the  Transformers , [48]  and becomes leader of the Mighty Avengers. [49]  The character makes an agreement with  Tony Stark , director of  S.H.I.E.L.D. , to lead a covert strike team called Operation: Lightning Storm, its designated mission being the elimination of supervillains before they become global threats. [50] \n Ms. Marvel is captured by the Brood on Monster Island, whereupon she found the Brood Queen. An intense confrontation ensued during which Ms. Marvel's powers are temporarily disabled, forcing her to fight the Brood Queen as Carol Danvers. At one point, she is stripped of her civilian  clothing  and was forced to drift through space until she was able to access her powers. [51] \n Ms. Marvel also plays a significant role in the 2008 storyline \" Secret Invasion \", [52]  in which members of the shapeshifting alien race, the  Skrulls , are revealed to have secretly infiltrated Earth by impersonating humans. She befriends  Captain Marvel's Skrull impostor  and proves to him that she is not a Skrull by revealing intimate details about their life together. At the conclusion of the war with the Skrulls,  Norman Osborn  is placed in charge of the registered Avengers team. Refusing to serve under Osborn, Ms. Marvel flees Avengers Tower, [53]  and joins the  New Avengers , [54]  becoming second-in-command. [55]  Osborn appoints former  Thunderbolt  member  Moonstone  (Karla Sofen) as the \"new\" Ms. Marvel to his  Dark Avengers  team; Moonstone wears a variation of Ms. Marvel's original costume. [53]  Osborn engineers a battle that results in Danvers's powers overloading, causing her apparent death. The character Moonstone takes over the title role in the ongoing  Ms. Marvel  series. [56]  Danvers returns with the aid of the New Avengers, a group of  MODOK   embryos  (creations of the organization  Advanced Idea Mechanics  [AIM]), and a character known as the \"Storyteller\" and reclaims the title of Ms. Marvel from Karla Sofen. [57] \n The increased use of Carol Danvers as a prominent character in many story arcs throughout this decade eventually prompted one commentator to note that \"she's now the House of Ideas' premier heroine\". [58] \n \n 2010s [ edit ] \n In the conclusion of the second volume of  Ms. Marvel , Carol Danvers battles her old nemesis  Mystique  and a clone of  Captain Marvel  created by the Skrulls during the Secret Invasion, after they carry out a series of tragedies at temples belonging to the Church of Hala, a church dedicated to Mar-Vell. [59]  Danvers later aids the allied forces of  Steve Rogers  against  Iron Patriot  during the  Siege of Asgard . [60] [61] [62]  Danvers also begins to develop a friendship with  Spider-Man . Though he infuriates her the first time they work together, [63]  the two become closer when he helps her during the \" Dark Reign \" storyline, and she later admits to having feelings for him. [64]  Following the conclusion of the \"Siege\" storyline, Ms. Marvel returns as a regular character in the second volume of  The New Avengers . [65] \n In July 2012, Carol Danvers assumed the mantle of  Captain Marvel  in an ongoing series written by  Kelly Sue DeConnick  with art by  Dexter Soy . Danvers dons a  jumpsuit  and explores her own past. When describing her pitch for the series at  WonderCon  2012 DeConnick said it could be \"pretty much be summed up with 'Carol Danvers as  Chuck Yeager . ' \" She said the series would contemplate what Captain Marvel's legend means to Danvers, how she will wield it, and how the rest of the  Marvel Universe  reacts. [66] \n Danvers also rejoined the main Avengers team as Captain Marvel in volume 5 of  The Avengers  and in the spin-off series,  Avengers Assemble , also written by DeConnick. [67]  Editor Lauren Sankovitch said that Marvel editors liked DeConnick's work and that adding her to the team would \"get some lady power in the Avengers lineup\". DeConnick said, \"You might know this \u2013 I have a certain affection for [Carol Danvers]. And I decided, 'Well, if I'm deciding, there will be a slot available for her as well. ' \" [68] \n In 2013, Carol Danvers starred in the  Captain Marvel  /  Avengers Assemble   crossover storyline , \"The Enemy Within\". In the story, Danvers and her Avenger teammates battle Yon-Rogg, the Kree commander who was responsible for the explosion that caused Danvers to receive her powers, and in defeating the Kree Danvers loses her memories. [69]  In November 2013, Marvel announced that Danvers would be joining the  Guardians of the Galaxy  beginning in  Free Comic Book Day : Guardians of the Galaxy  (May 2014) by  Brian Michael Bendis  and  Sara Pichelli . [70]  In March 2014, Marvel launched an eighth volume of  Captain Marvel  written again by DeConnick and starring Danvers in the title role but drawn by artist  David L\u00f3pez . DeConnick said, \"The big difference is we were grounded in New York City for the previous volume; at least in the latter part of it. With the new  Captain Marvel  #1 we start in NYC but after that we're letting her go cosmic. Carol will be spending time off planet.\" [71] \n During the 2015 \" Secret Wars \" storyline, Danvers headlined her own tie-in series,  Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps  co-written by DeConnick and  Kelly Thompson  and drawn by L\u00f3pez. In the series, Danvers leads an elite squadron of female fighter pilots stationed at an airbase called Hala Field, where she is the only superpowered being; this leads the corps to help Danvers answer questions about her origin, which puts her in conflict with the controlling forces of  Battleworld . [72]  During the storyline, Danvers becomes a member of  A-Force , Battleworld's all-female team of Avengers. The series, written by  G. Willow Wilson , continued into Marvel's \" All-New, All-Different Marvel \" relaunch campaign that followed \"Secret Wars\", with Danvers in a key role. [73] \n Continuing with the All-New, All-Different Marvel\" initiative, Danvers starred in the ninth volume of  Captain Marvel , written by  Agent Carter  showrunners  Tara Butters  and  Michele Fazekas , with artwork by  Kris Anka , which debuted in October 2015. The series, set eight months after \"Secret Wars\", sees Danvers taking over the responsibilities of  S.W.O.R.D. , the military agency that was previously designated to protect Earth from intergalactic threats. Editor  Sana Amanat  said, \"This is really meant to be the next level for Captain Marvel. Carol is really meant to be a soldier and a commander, and also a diplomat. We're really trying to build up this space complex and this space world.\" [74]  At this time, Danvers also joined  The Ultimates . Series writer  Al Ewing  said, \"Carol's currently running Alpha Flight, which is Earth's premier space agency. [She has] seen the highs and the lows of the superhero business, and come out the other side. Right now, Carol's in the ascendant, culturally, both in-universe and outside it... Carol's story in  The Ultimates  is very much about her links with the ordinary super-hero world, and about trying to form a bridge between that world and the world of The Ultimates.\" [75] \n In 2016, Danvers played a predominant role in the storyline \" Civil War II \", the core miniseries of which was written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by  David Marquez . In the story, Danvers is the leader of a faction of superheroes who wish to use  Ulysses'  precognitive power to profile people who in his visions, will commit future crimes. About her position Bendis stated, \"From Carol's point of view, she is like, 'You're telling me the world is still turning at the end of the day and everyone is safe? I don't care... If it keeps us safe, that's fine. ' \" [76]  Following the conclusion of \"Civil War II\", Danvers starred in  The Mighty Captain Marvel , by writer  Margaret Stohl  and artist  Ramon Rosanas , which sees Danvers become a household name. Stohl explained, \"She will be one of the most popular heroes on the planet\u2014but that's not something she is very comfortable with. And of course she's lost a lot of folks that she's loved so she has to cope with that, too. That being said, she still has a job to do as commander of the Alpha Flight. Her latest mission being recruiting and training new cadets. It'll also bring with it a mysterious danger that will threaten everything Carol has built.\" [77] \n Beginning in July 2018, Danvers headlined a limited series titled,  The Life of Captain Marvel , by Stohl and artist  Carlos Pacheco . The series is described as a \"retelling\" of Danvers' origin story but Stohl insisted that it is not a \"reinvention\" explaining, \"You look through a different lens. It's nothing you'll expect and nothing you've seen happen but there will be parts of her life that change the context of what you've seen before, so it's telling the other side of the story, of how she came to be.\" Stohl also said that there would be similarities with the  2019 film , but the film is \"its own thing\". [78]  The series reveals that Danvers' mother is Kree and that the blast that was responsible for her powers only awakened her preexisting Kree genes, and did not fuse her human DNA with Mar-Vell's Kree DNA as  originally written . [79] \n Danvers is scheduled to star in the tenth volume of  Captain Marvel  written by  Kelly Thompson  and drawn by  Carmen Carnero . The story sees Danvers return to New York City after a stint in space and reconnect with allies and friends like Iron Man and Spider-Woman, as well as explore new relationships. Thompson teased, \"There will definitely be some romance and it may be someone we all know and have seen before in Marvel Comics.\" [80] \n \n Characterization [ edit ] \n With  Ms. Marvel  #1 in 1977, writer  Gerry Conway  played a significant role in the character's development, writing in his introduction to the series, \"you might see a parallel between  her  quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness, for self-liberation, for identity\". [81] \n Ms. Marvel's uniform and abilities, however, were derived from the character's then-contemporary male counterpart: Captain Marvel. The  Ms. Marvel   letters page  (\"Ms. Prints\") featured letters debating whether or not the character was feminist. Reader (and frequent  letterhack ) Jana C. Hollingsworth took issue with Ms. Marvel's entire origin:\n \n .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} For the eleven years I've been a comics fan, I've been proud of how Marvel resisted the temptation to create male-based heroines \u00e0 la Supergirl. It's been proudly proclaimed that Ms. Marvel is  not   Marvel Girl ; well, maybe the early Marvel Girl did have weak powers and an insipid personality, but at least her powers were  her  powers and her personality was  her  personality.... I hope you can change her costume if it's all possible, and keep her on her own instead of associating her with Captain Marvel.... [82] \n \n Another reader had issue with the character's outfit: \"Question: where is a woman who wears long sleeves, gloves, high boots and a scarf (winter wear), and at the same time has a bare back, belly, and legs? The Arctic equator? That costume requires a few alterations.\" [83]  These questions, and the controversial rape in  Avengers  #200, caused many readers to question the character's portrayal, and whether she was a good role model for female readers: [84] \n \n As Carol [Strickland] pointed out in her article in  LOC  [#1], women tend to get very short shrift in comics. They are either portrayed as wallflowers or as supermacho insensitive men with different body forms, who almost invariably feel guilty about their lack of femininity. And it's always seemed to me that, why does this have to be exclusive? Can you not have a woman who is ruthless and capable and courageous and articulate and intelligent and all the other buzz-words\u2014heroic when the need arises, and yet feminine and gentle and compassionate, at others? That was what I tried to do with Ms. Marvel. I tried to create a character who had all the attributes that made her a top-secret agent yet at the same time was a compassionate, warm, humorous, witty, intelligent, attractive woman.\n \n It has been noted that \"Danvers' initial appearances portrayed her as a strong character, but that changed over time\u2014even after she gained super powers.\" [85]  When Ms. Marvel received her own title in the 2000s, Marvel Comics was \"determined to have the character take center stage in the Marvel Universe\", with \"Joe Quesada and the other powers [having] had the character play major roles in their huge 'House of M' crossover, in the 'New Avengers' and in the gargantuan success that is 'Civil War'.\" \"Writer Brian Reed has had Ms. Marvel overcome worthy challenges ranging from alien invasions, time-traveling sorcerers and former teammates turned enemy.\" [86]  Brian Reed's characterization of Ms. Marvel (in the \"War of the Marvels\" story arc [57] ) has been said to be \"an engaging mix of bravado and aggression juxtaposed with compassion and empathy\". [58] \n The Carol Danvers incarnation of  Ms. Marvel  was the top-ranked female character (at #11) on  IGN 's 2012 list of the \"Top 50 Avengers\". [87]  She is listed #29 in  Comics Buyer's Guide ' s \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\". [88] \n \n Powers and abilities [ edit ] \n As Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers initially possessed superhuman strength, endurance, stamina, physical durability, a limited precognitive \"seventh sense\" and a perfectly amalgamated human/Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons. She originally only had the power of flight thanks to a contraption under her suit.  As Binary, the character could tap the energy of a \" white hole \", allowing full control and manipulation of stellar energies, and therefore control over heat, the  electromagnetic spectrum  and  gravity .  Light speed  travel and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space were also possible. [89] \n Although the link to the white hole was eventually severed, Danvers retains her Binary powers on a smaller scale, enabling her to both absorb energy and project it in photonic form. She can also still survive in space. While she lacks a constant source of energy to maintain the abilities at their previous cosmic level, she can temporarily assume her Binary form if empowered with a high enough infusion of energy.\n Danvers possesses superhuman strength and durability, can fly at roughly six times the speed of sound, [90]  retains her \"seventh sense\", and can discharge explosive blasts of radiant energy, which she fires from her fingertips. She also demonstrates the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection, up to the force of an exploding nuclear weapon. [47]  When sufficiently augmented, she can withstand the pressure from a ninety-two-ton weight and strike with a similar level of force, although  Hank Pym  theorized that this likely was not her limit. [91]  Danvers cannot absorb magical energy without consequence, though she aided Dr. Stephen Strange in the defeat of the mystic menace, Sir Warren Traveler. [92] \n \n Other versions [ edit ] \n \"Age of Apocalypse\" [ edit ] \n In the 1995 \" Age of Apocalypse \" storyline, a powerless Carol Danvers helps Logan and  Gateway  escape at the price of her life, only to be \"healed\" and used by  Donald Pierce  as a living weapon against her friends. [93] \n \n \"Age of Ultron\" [ edit ] \n In the 2013 \" Age of Ultron \" storyline, a version of Captain Marvel was seen vacationing in London when the  Ultron  Sentinels arrive. Captain Marvel is assisted in the fight against the Ultron Sentinels by  Captain Britain  and  MI-13 . After Computer Graham and Magic Boots Mel are killed in battle, Captain Marvel and Captain Britain sacrifice their lives to stop the Ultron Sentinels that were invading London. [94] \n \n Amalgam [ edit ] \n In the  Amalgam Comics  universe, Carol Danvers was combined with  Helena Bertinelli  of DC Comics and became this reality's  Huntress . She's a rogue ex-government solo agent (although that may merely have been a cover story for a deep mission) who uses her specialized skills and training as an agent for hire. Her crossbow was developed for her by  Hawkeye  (Clint  Archer ) of the Judgment League Avengers. [95]  She appears in the  Legends of the Dark Claw  one-shot where she discovers Dark Claw's secret identity and aids him in tracking down the Hyena. [96] \n \n Exiles [ edit ] \n An evil version of the character features in the title  Exiles , joining the  alternate universe  explorers  Weapon X  and becoming the lover of master villain  Hyperion . [97] \n \n Marvel Mangaverse [ edit ] \n In  Marvel Mangaverse , Carol Danvers was pilot of the U.S.Airforce which was stationed in Japan. After  Sunfire  and his allies destroyed their base and killed Carol's partner,  Rachel Leighton , Carol tried to fight, but was wounded by  Silver Samurai  and  Lady Deathstrike . After being healed at the hospital, she developed superpowers and infiltrated the  Hand 's base and took notes about their plans after dispatching the ressurected  Elektra . She then took the mantle of  Captain America  and saved  Spider-Man  and helped the other heroes battling the Hand. She displays superhuman strength and a near-invulnerability in the miniseries. No genuine explanation is given to how her powers came to exist in the Mangaverse (though it is implied that she somehow gained them after exposure to attacks from the Rings of the Mandarin, as she claims she can feel the power of the Rings while climbing Mt. Fuji in the final issue of the series, indicating she followed them back to their present location on foot from the air base.), as she appears at first as a normal human. [98] \n \n Ultimate Marvel [ edit ] \n The  Ultimate Marvel  imprint features a version of the character without superhuman abilities named  Captain Carol Danvers  in the \" Ultimate Galactus Trilogy \" storyline. As a  U.S. Air Force  officer, she was assigned to work on  Mahr Vehl 's security detail with  General Nick Fury  when Earth was threatened by  Gah Lak Tus . [99] [100] [101]  In the title  Ultimate Power , the character becomes acting director of  S.H.I.E.L.D.  after  Nick Fury 's disappearance. [102]  Her first missions involved working with the  Fantastic Four  and the  X-Men  opposing threats like  Apocalypse , [103]  and the  Silver Surfer . [104]  In  Ultimate Spider-Man , she works on apprehending  Norman Osborn  after he escapes from the Triskelion. [105]  Things got difficult for her when Norman lied to the press that S.H.I.E.L.D. wrongly imprisoned him for trying to make the world a safer place, putting the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents out of a job. [105] \n She receives help from  Spider-Man  (Peter Parker) after she arrests him in public, hoping that it would lure Norman to her. She summoned a press release and had  Harry Osborn  tell the reporters the truth that Norman was a horrible person for experimenting on himself and killing his mother. [105]  Outraged, Norman went to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and attacked his son along with her, Spider-Man, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on board. Norman accidentally killed Harry and, feeling guilty, tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to kill him. Spider-Man becomes angry at Danvers because Harry died on her watch and told her to stay out of his life. She did not do as he asked, but she still felt sorry for him. [106] \n As S.H.I.E.L.D. Director, Danvers was put in command of the newly formed New Ultimates. When Loki attempted another invasion of Earth, Danvers and the women of the team ( Zarda  and  Valkyrie ) were placed under a spell by  Amora . Danvers, using technology, was able to resist the spell and was able to free the rest of the team to battle Loki's forces. [107] \n After Spider-Man was captured and replaced by the  Chameleon , Danvers decided that having Peter, untrained, loose in the city was doing more harm than good. She approached  May Parker  and they both agreed that Peter would attend training lessons from individual members of the New Ultimates. [108] \n Danvers and her New Ultimates battled Nick Fury and his Avengers while each side accused the other of being traitors to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United States of America. During the fight, Danvers was hit by a Police Cruiser, leaving her in critical condition. Her role as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director was then passed on to  Gregory Stark , the one that had in fact engineered the events from the start. [109]  After Stark is killed, Fury replaced Danvers as director. [110] \n \n Infinity Warps [ edit ] \n In Warp World, a copy of the  Marvel Universe  folded in half during the  Infinity Wars  storyline, Carol Danvers was fused with  Justice Peace , creating Captain Peace. She travels from the  year 2099  to the present where she tells Weapon Hex (fusion between  Scarlet Witch  and  X-23 ) that her victory against the Demon invasion caused the  Martians  to invade Earth. [111] \n \n X-Men: The End [ edit ] \n The 2004\u20132006 miniseries trilogy  X-Men: The End  features a version of the character that exists as pure energy and controls the  Starjammers ' spaceship,  The Starjammer . [112] \n \n Universe X [ edit ] \n In the  Universe X  limited series, a version of Carol Danvers allied with Mar-Vell and she along with  Nova ,  Quasar  and  Starlord  formed the Realm Marvel. [113] [114] \n \n Deadpool kills Deadpool [ edit ] \n In  Deadpool Kills Deadpool , a version of Carol along with a version of  Invisible Woman  were captured by  Dreadpool . [115] \n \n Age of Sentry [ edit ] \n In  Age of Sentry , a version of Carol Danvers is a sidekick to the  Sentry . [116] \n \n Infinity Countdown [ edit ] \n During the  Infinity Countdown , Carol Danvers of the main timeline sees some alternate universes of herself:\n \n A version of Carol used the Nega-Bands to switch places with Mar-Vell, with her developing cancer instead of Mar-Vell. [117] \n A version of Carol switched bodies with Rogue after absorbing the powers, memories and personalities of one another. [117] \n A version of Carol who didn't overcome her alcoholism, she became a homeless person, whom  Monica Rambeau  as Captain Marvel tried to help her by bringing her to a shelter, however, Carol would wound up back in the streets. [117] \n What If? [ edit ] \n In  What If?  Norman Osborn won Siege , Carol was one of the heroes fighting Norman, but she eventually was killed by  Venom . [118] \n In  What If? Annihilation Wave reached Earth , Ms. Marvel and other heroes abandoned the Civil War in order to fight the  Annihilation Wave . [119] \n In  What If? Scarlet Witch Ended the 'House of M' By Saying, 'No More Power? , Carol Danvers was among the heroes, who were depowered by the  Scarlet Witch  after  House of M . Despite this, Carol joined Iron Man's Iron Avengers and received her own Iron Man Armor in order to fight the  Red Skull . [120] \n Marvel Universe vs The Punisher [ edit ] \n In  Marvel Universe Vs. The Punisher , Carol Danvers was part of the population who were infected from a virus which was accidentally spread by  the Punisher  and turned the people into cannibals. She allied with the  Thing , but was later killed by the Punisher. [121] \n \n Venomverse: War Stories [ edit ] \n In the universe of the  Venomized   Rocket Raccoon , the Kree put a bounty on Carol Danvers as Captain America. Rocket planned to kill Captain America and claim the bounty, but they were evenly matched causing the battle to not end, until Rocket was pulled into another dimension. [122] \n \n In other media [ edit ] \n Television [ edit ] \n Ms. Marvel appeared in the  X-Men  animated series, [123]  voiced by  Roscoe Handford . [124]  The episode \"A Rogue's Tale\" details how  Rogue  gained Ms. Marvel's powers at the behest of Mystique, leaving her in a coma. A second echo of Ms. Marvel remained in Rogue's mind, however, and was threatening to take over her. Rogue's friend  Jean Grey  had to ultimately get inside Rogue's mind and seal said echo away, to keep Rogue from going insane. The last scene has a distressed Rogue visiting the still comatose Ms. Marvel in the hospital, with the implication that she might wake up sooner or later. \n Ms. Marvel appears in the  Spider-Woman: Agent of S.W.O.R.D.  motion comics, voiced by Tena Nelson. [125] \n Ms. Marvel appears in  The Super Hero Squad Show , voiced by  Grey DeLisle . [126]  This version is depicted as a strict  S.H.I.E.L.D.  agent who is the superior of the Super Hero Squad. \n Carol Danvers appears in  The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes , voiced by  Jennifer Hale . [125]  She first appears in the episode \"459\". Carol later gains her super powers in the episode \"Welcome to the Kree Empire\", and assumes the Ms. Marvel identity. She joins the Avengers and appears as a regular character for the remainder of the series. \n Captain Marvel has a non-voiced cameo appearance in  Avengers Assemble .

[133] \n Kim Raver  voices Captain Marvel in the 2018 animated film,  Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors . [134] \n Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel is portrayed by  Brie Larson  in the  Marvel Cinematic Universe .\n Danvers first appears in  Captain Marvel , [135]  which was released in the United States on March 8, 2019. [136]  In the film, she's a test pilot who works under  Dr. Wendy Lawson ; while testing an experimental engine with her, they are shot down by the Kree and Lawson reveals she is a renegade Kree named Mar-Vell, who has been working against her government to assist refugee Skrulls. The Kree kill Mar-Vell, but Danvers successfully destroys the engine harnessing its power from the Tesseract, and its explosion leaves her with deeply powerful energy-manipulation abilities. However, her memories were wiped by the incident. After a period in the Kree  Starforce  (with her being referred to simply as \"Vers\", the only part of her name legible from the remains of her broken dog tag), she returns to Earth, discovers her origins while working with  Nick Fury , and unlocks her full potential. The film concludes with her departing with the Skrull refugees to find them a new planet, but she leaves a modified pager with Nick Fury that he can use to call her in the event of a major emergency. Fury is inspired by her example to propose gathering exceptional individuals together to defend Earth from unconventional threats; he names this protocol \"the Avengers Initiative\" after Danvers' old callsign. In the film's  mid-credits scene , set in the aftermath of  Avengers: Infinity War , she returns to Earth after answering Fury's distress signal, only to confront the surviving members of the  Avengers , who were monitoring Fury's pager after  Thanos  wiped out half of all life in the universe. She asks them about Fury's whereabouts, not yet aware that he was among those killed. \n In  Avengers: Endgame , which was released in the United States on April 26, 2019, [137] [138]  Danvers brings  Tony Stark  and  Nebula  to Earth when she tracks down the homing beacon on the  Benetar  (where the two had been since their allies died on Titan) after meeting the Avengers and being brought up to speed on the events of  Infinity War . [139]  Danvers joins  Steve Rogers ,  Natasha Romanoff ,  Bruce Banner ,  James Rhodes ,  Thor ,  Rocket  and Nebula on a mission to confront and restrain Thanos in an attempt to reverse the snap, only to discover that Thanos has already destroyed the stones to prevent further use. Five years later, Danvers remains part of the Avengers, monitoring other planets in the universe that are recovering from the snap. She returns to Earth to assist the Avengers in their final stand against Thanos and tries to stop him from using the stones to destroy the universe, but is blasted away when he uses the Power Stone against her, prompting  Doctor Strange  to gesture that it's up to Stark to ensure the Avengers' victory. Stark then takes the stones and uses them to destroy Thanos and his army, sacrificing himself in the process. Danvers attends Stark's funeral, briefly reuniting with Fury. \n Novels [ edit ] \n A Captain Marvel prose novel by  Shannon Hale  and Dean Hale was announced at  New York Comic-Con  2015.

The X-Men appeared in the  Sub-Mariner  episode \"Dr. Doom's Day / The Doomed Allegiance / Tug of Death\". Though the episode was adapted from  Fantastic Four  No. 6 (1962) and  Fantastic Four Annual  No. 3 (1965),  Grantray-Lawrence Animation  did not have the rights to the Fantastic Four (their series was produced by  Hanna-Barbera ), and so instead substituted the X-Men. [1]  The X-Men are never referred to in this episode as the  X-Men  but rather as the  Allies for Peace . [2]  The characters kept their original looks and individual names from the comics.\n \n Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends  (1981\u20131983) [ edit ] \n The X-Men guest-starred in several episodes of  Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends , which included Iceman, along with  Spider-Man  and  Firestar , as the main characters, starting with a flashback in \"The Origin of Iceman\". [2]  Appearing in this particular episode are Professor X and the five original X-Men: Iceman, the Angel, the Beast, Marvel Girl, and Cyclops. For the continuity of the show, Firestar was also a former member of the X-Men. X-Men member  Sunfire  would also pop up on his own in a later episode teaming up with the Amazing Friends, as well as representing a romantic interest for Firestar.\n The X-Men's next appearance was in the episode \"A Firestar is Born\", [2]  which included appearances from Professor X,  Storm , the Angel, Cyclops,  Wolverine , and the  Juggernaut  and cameos by  Magneto  and a  Sentinel .\n The X-Men would return the following season in the episode titled \"The X-Men Adventure\". [2]  Making appearances this time were: Professor X, Cyclops,  Sprite , Storm,  Nightcrawler ,  Colossus , and  Thunderbird . This episode was meant to be a pilot for an X-Men cartoon that was slated to feature the X-Men characters, plus Lady Lightning (an animated version of  Carol Danvers / Ms. Marvel ) and  Videoman  as members. [3]  The series was never produced.\n \n Pryde of the X-Men  (1989) [ edit ] \n In 1989,  Marvel Productions  produced a half-hour pilot X-Men episode titled  X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men . It related the story of Kitty Pryde's first adventure with the team of mutants which included Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and  Dazzler  as they fought against Magneto, the  White Queen , the Juggernaut, the  Blob ,  Pyro , and the  Toad . [2]  The series was never picked up but the single episode aired infrequently in  syndication  during the  Marvel Action Universe  series and was released on video in 1990. [1] \n In 1991, a  six-player arcade game  and a four-player version were based upon the pilot starring Cyclops, Colossus, Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Dazzler as the playable characters. Kitty Pryde and Professor X also appear. [4] \n \n X-Men  (1992\u20131997) [ edit ] \n In 1992,  the Fox network  launched an  X-Men  animated series  with the roster of  Cyclops ,  Wolverine ,  Rogue ,  Storm ,  Beast ,  Gambit ,  Jubilee ,  Jean Grey , and  Professor X  with secondary background player  Morph  making occasional appearances. The two-part pilot episode, \"Night of the Sentinels\" began a five-season series. It was an extraordinary success and helped to widen the X-Men's popularity. [2]  The five seasons ended in 1997. It returned to Fox's line-up for several months after the first movie was released in 2000. [5] \n \n Spider-Man  (1995\u20131997) [ edit ] \n The X-Men guest starred on  Spider-Man  in episodes \"The Mutant Agenda\" and \"Mutants Revenge\", when  Spider-Man  seeks Professor X's help with his growing mutation disease. Storm would later guest-star in the  Secret Wars  arc. [2] \n \n Fantastic Four  (1995) [ edit ] \n Cyclops, Jean Grey, Gambit, Wolverine, Storm, and the Juggernaut, along with the  Scarlet Spider , made cameos in the  Fantastic Four  series, in the episode \"Nightmare in Green\", as the  Human Torch  flies overhead. [6] \n \n X-Men: Evolution  (2000\u20132003) [ edit ] \n In 2000,  The WB  launched the  X-Men: Evolution  television series, which portrayed the X-Men as teenagers attending a regular public high school in addition to the Xavier Institute. The series ended in 2003 after its fourth season. The show focused on Cyclops, Jean Grey, Spyke (Storm's nephew), Storm, Wolverine, Rogue, Beast, Shadowcat and Nightcrawler. [2] \n \n Spider-Man: The New Animated Series  (2003) [ edit ] \n The X-Men and mutant-kind are mentioned in an episode of the short-lived CGI series  Spider-Man: The New Animated Series  called \"The Party\". Peter Parker is quoted as saying, \"I bet the X-Men get to go to parties.\" Soon after, he is ambushed by a group of cops, one of them calling him a \" mutant  freak\". [7] \n \n X-Men: Darktide  (2006) [ edit ] \n In 2006,  Minimates  released a short animated  brickfilm  called  X-Men: Darktide  on DVD with a box set of figures. [8]  The story involved the X-Men battling the  Brotherhood  at an  oil rig . The X-Men team consists of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Archangel, Wolverine, the Beast, Xavier and Storm. The Brotherhood team is  Mystique , Magneto and the Juggernaut.\n \n Wolverine and the X-Men  (2009) [ edit ] \n In 2008,  Marvel Studios  released a new X-Men animated show that featured Wolverine titled  Wolverine and the X-Men . This series used a mesh of 2D/3D animation for characters and backgrounds. [9]   Avi Arad , CEO of Marvel Studios, stated \"X-Men is one of Marvel's crown jewels and it makes sense to focus on the popular Wolverine character for our second animation project.\" [10]  The series debuted in the United States on January 23, 2009 and in the U.K. in February. [9] [11]  It also aired in Latin America and Canada. The team consisted of Wolverine, Emma Frost, Cyclops, the Beast, Storm, Shadowcat, Iceman, Rogue, Nightcrawler, the Angel, Jean Grey and Professor X. The show was cancelled just after one season due to financing issues. [2] \n \n The Super Hero Squad Show  (2009) [ edit ] \n The X-Men appeared on  Cartoon Network 's  The Super Hero Squad Show . [12] \n \n Marvel Animation: X-Men  (2011) [ edit ] \n As part of a  four-series collaboration  between the Japanese  Madhouse  animation house and Marvel, the X-Men starred in a 12 episode  anime  series that premiered in Japan on  Animax  and in the United States on  G4  in 2011.
